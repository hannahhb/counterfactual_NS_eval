According to the premises, all volunteers receive intangible benefits for their work. However, the premises do not mention robots as volunteers, nor do they specify that robots receive any intangible benefits.

Therefore, the statement that India's economy is not declining follows directly from the given information.\n\nANSWER: True\n", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if India's economy is not declining. The premises state that India is one of the BRICS and its economy is emerging. However, the premises do not provide any information about whether the economy is declining or not. We know that India's economy is emerging, but there is no direct information about its decline status. Therefore, we cannot conclude whether India's economy is not declining or declining based on the given premises.\n\nANSWER: Uncertain\n", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if India's economy is not declining. From the premises, we know that India is one of the BRICS and its economy is emerging. We do not have any information that suggests the economy is declining. Since \"emerging\" is a term typically used to describe an economy that is growing and developing, it implies that the economy is not declining. Therefore, the statement \"India's economy is not declining\" is true.\nANSWER: True\n", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if India's economy is not declining. From premise 2, we know that India is one of the BRICS and its economy is emerging. An emerging economy is generally considered as an economy that is developing but not yet fully developed, and the term does not imply a declining economy. Thus, the information given supports that India's economy is emerging and does not indicate that it is declining. Therefore, the statement \"India's economy is not declining\" is true based on the given premises.\nANSWER: True\n", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if India's economy is not declining. According to the premises, India is one of the BRICS and its economy is emerging. This does not directly state that India's economy is not declining, but it does indicate that it is in a state of emergence, which typically implies a growing or improving economy rather than a declining one. Given that the premises do not provide any information suggesting a decline, and that India's economy is described as \"emerging,\" it is reasonable to conclude that India's economy is not declining. Therefore, the statement is true.\nANSWER: True\n", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if India's economy is not declining. From the premises, we know that India is one of the BRICS, and its economy is emerging. The term \"emerging\" typically refers to a growing economy, not a declining one. Therefore, we can infer that India's economy is not declining.

Since mammals are vertebrates, and Grebes are not mammals (since they are not platypuses or echidnas), they are still vertebrates but not mammals.

First, from premise 1, we know that the only mammals that lay eggs are platypuses or echidnas. Grebes are not platypuses and not echidnas, so if grebes are mammals, they cannot lay eggs. However, it is stated in premise 8 that grebes do lay eggs. Since grebes lay eggs and they are not the only egg-laying mammals (platypuses or echidnas), grebes cannot be mammals.

From premise 4, we know that in La Liga 2021-2022, Real Madrid received more points than Barcelona. Therefore, in La Liga 2021-2022, Real Madrid received more points than Barcelona, so Real Madrid ranks higher than Barcelona, so the statement is true.\nANSWER:\tTrue\n</EVALUATE>\n\n---\n<PREMISES>\nAll athletes are good at sports.\nAll Olympic gold medal winners are good athletes.\nNo scientists are good at sports.\nAll Nobel laureates are scientists.\nAmy is good at sports or Amy is an Olympic gold medal winner.\nIf Amy is not a Nobel laureate, then Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner.\n</PREMISES>\n<CONCLUSION>\nIf Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner, then Amy is a Nobel laureate.\n</CONCLUSION>\n<EVALUATE>\n\nLet's think step by step. We want to evaluate the statement \"if Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner, then Amy is a Nobel laureate\". Let's assume that Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner. This doesn't tell us anything about whether Amy is a Nobel laureate, so the statement isn't true, meaning it is either False or Uncertain. To distinguish between the two, notice that we could have a scenario where Amy is neither an Olympic gold medal winner nor a Nobel laureate. None of the premises are violated in this case.

We want to evaluate if James contributes to the country. Let's think about what we know about James. First, we know that James was either sentenced for thief or stayed in prison. However, this doesn't tell us anything about whether James contributed to the country. Second, we know that James either had a bad record in the local state or that he was respected by others. However, the premises don't tell us anything about the relationship between having a bad record and contributing to the country.

We want to evaluate if Inception is a folk song. We know that Inception is a sci-fi movie. Since all movies are videos and Inception is a movie, it is a video, which means it is visual. On the other hand, we know that all folk songs are songs, and no songs are visual, so no folk songs are visual. Therefore, since Inception is visual but no folk songs are visual, we know that Inception cannot be a folk song, so the statement is false.\nANSWER:\tFalse\n</EVALUATE>\n\n---\n<PREMISES>\nEvery chef can cook.\nSome people who aren\u2019t chefs can cook.\nPeople who cook can make scrambled eggs and pasta.\nIf someone can make cookies and muffins, they are a baker.\nBakers who can also make scrambled eggs can make a good breakfast.\nLuke can make cookies, scrambled eggs, and muffins, but not pasta.\n</PREMISES>\n<CONCLUSION>\nLuke can make a good breakfast.\n</CONCLUSION>\n<EVALUATE>\n\nLet's think step by step.
