Therefore, one must at all costs avoid giving in to the desires of the lower self.
People who live in the West can be said to be associated with the shadow, and as such, may be negatively influenced by it.
In the materialistic, independent West, the shadow is often expressed in and through the development of the ego.
If the ego trumps the higher Self, then the person may give in to their lower self.
The concept of the "higher Self" can be understood by understanding the concept of "Self" in Eastern philosophies.
In addition to the West, Eastern philosophies were widely studied in the United States until the early 1960s.
We as human beings are made of the materialistic world and the spiritual world.

<EVALUATE>
ANSWER: True
</EVALUATE> 

Explanation:
The problem is to evaluate the conclusion as ANSWER: True, ANSWER: False, or ANSWER: Uncertain given the premises. 
This is a problem of first-order predicate logic (FOL) and requires the application of logical rules and inference techniques to determine the truth of the conclusion. 
The solution involves analyzing the premises, identifying the relevant logical relationships, and determining the validity of the conclusion based on these relationships.

Step 1: Analyze the premises and identify relevant logical relationships.
The premises provide information about the MAN-2007 car, its availability, and the characteristics of European cars. 
The relevant logical relationships involve the existence of the MAN-2007, its availability in different regions, and the characteristics of European cars.

Step 2: Apply logical rules and inference techniques to determine the validity of the conclusion.
Given that the MAN-2007 is a European car, and some MAN cars are available for purchase in North America, we can infer that some MAN cars, including the MAN-2007, may be available in North America. 
However, it is also stated that the MAN-2007 is not available for sale in North America. 
This creates a conflict between the premises, and we cannot determine with certainty whether the conclusion is true or false based on the given information.

Step 3: Determine the final answer.
Based on the analysis, we cannot determine the truth of the conclusion with certainty, as there is a conflict between the premises. 
Therefore, the final answer is ANSWER: Uncertain.

The final answer is: ANSWER: Uncertain.
Processed: False
