TEXT: Ambiortus Dementjevi is the only known species of Ambiortus.
FOL: Species(AmbiortusDementjevi) & all x. (SpeciesOf(x, Ambiortus) -> x = AmbiortusDementjevi)

FOL: Discoverer(Ambiortus, YevgenyKurochkin)
TEXT: Yevgeny Kurochkin discovered a new bird genus.
FOL: DiscoveredNewGenus(YevgenyKurochkin, BirdGenus)

Note: The last FOL expression could be interpreted differently depending on how "new" is defined in this context. Here it's assumed that "new" means any bird genus, considering that "Ambiortus" is introduced as a prehistoric bird genus in the premises and its discovery is attributed to Yevgeny Kurochkin. However, the term "new" might imply it wasn't known before the discovery, which may require additional clarification or context beyond the given premises.
Processed: Uncertain

Generation 2:
TEXT: Ambiortus is a prehistoric bird genus.
FOL: PrehistoricBirdGenus(Ambiortus)
TEXT: Ambiortus Dementjevi is the only known species of Ambiortus.

FOL: Discoverer(Ambiortus, YevgenyKurochkin)
TEXT: Yevgeny Kurochkin discovered a new bird genus.
FOL: Exists x. (PrehistoricBirdGenus(x) & Discoverer(x, YevgenyKurochkin))

Note: The conclusion's logical form suggests we are asserting that there exists at least one bird genus discovered by Yevgeny Kurochkin. Given the premises, since Ambiortus is indeed a prehistoric bird genus and its discoverer is Yevgeny Kurochkin, the conclusion logically follows.
Processed: Error

Generation 3:
TEXT: Ambiortus is a prehistoric bird genus.

FOL: Discoverer(YevgenyKurochkin, Ambiortus)
TEXT: Yevgeny Kurochkin discovered a new bird genus.
FOL: DiscoverNewGenus(YevgenyKurochkin, BirdGenus)

Note: The conclusion's FOL expression might need adjustment depending on the exact interpretation of "discovered a new bird genus" in the context of the given premises. Here, it assumes a predicate indicating the discovery of a new genus specifically within the category of birds. However, based on the premises, it might be more precise to directly use the specific genus name 'Ambiortus' in the conclusion's FOL translation to match the premises given, such as:

TEXT: A highly developed city is located in the western hemisphere of the earth.
FOL: Located(HighlyDevelopedCity, WesternHemisphere) 

Note: For the conclusion, the representation `HighlyDevelopedCity` implies any highly developed city. However, the translation should specify that if a particular city, such as New York City, meets this condition, then the statement can be made about it specifically, rather than making a universal claim without evidence that all highly developed cities meet the location criteria provided in the premises.

</CONCLUSION>
<EVALUATE>

Generation 1:
TEXT: Xiufeng, Xiangshan, Diecai, Qixing are districts in the city of Guilin.
FOL: District(Guilin, Xiufeng) & District(Guilin, Xiangshan) & District(Guilin, Diecai) & District(Guilin, Qixing)
TEXT: Yangshuo is not a district in Guilin.
FOL: -District(Guilin, Yangshuo)
TEXT: Xiangshan and Diecai are districts in the same city.
FOL: SameCity(District(Xiangshan), District(Diecai))

Note: The translation of the conclusion assumes that "same city" refers to the fact that both districts belong to Guilin. However, the FOL expression needs to be interpreted correctly within the context of the premises where we know they are all in Guilin. Thus, a more direct translation of the conclusion based on the premises would be:
FOL: District(Guilin, Xiangshan) & District(Guilin, Diecai)
This directly asserts that both Xiangshan and Diecai are districts in Guilin, which is implied by the premises.
Processed: Error

Generation 2:
TEXT: Xiufeng, Xiangshan, Diecai, Qixing are districts in the city of Guilin.
FOL: District(Guilin, Xiufeng) & District(Guilin, Xiangshan) & District(Guilin, Diecai) & District(Guilin, Qixing)
TEXT: Yangshuo is not a district in Guilin.
FOL: -District(Guilin, Yangshuo)
TEXT: Xiangshan and Diecai are districts in the same city.
FOL: SameCity(District(Xiangshan), District(Diecai))

Note: The translation for the conclusion assumes a binary predicate `SameCity/2` to express that Xiangshan and Diecai belong to the same city. However, given the context, this could be simplified based on the premise information as both being districts of Guilin inherently implies they are in the same city. Thus, the FOL representation for the conclusion might need to be adjusted for clarity:

TEXT: Xiangshan and Diecai are districts in the same city.
FOL: District(Guilin, Xiangshan) & District(Guilin, Diecai)

This directly states that both Xiangshan and Diecai are districts of Guilin, which is enough to imply they are in the same city, given the premises.

Generation 3:
TEXT: Xiufeng, Xiangshan, Diecai, Qixing are districts in the city of Guilin.
FOL: District(Xiufeng, Guilin) & District(Xiangshan, Guilin) & District(Diecai, Guilin) & District(Qixing, Guilin)
TEXT: Yangshuo is not a district in Guilin.
FOL: -District(Yangshuo, Guilin)
TEXT: Xiangshan and Diecai are districts in the same city.
FOL: SameCity(District(Xiangshan, Guilin), District(Diecai, Guilin))

Note: For the last translation, the expression uses a hypothetical `SameCity` predicate to represent the notion that two entities are within the same city, as directly representing this fact in FOL with the information given might require additional context or simplification, such as assuming `SameCity(District(X, City1), District(Y, City1))` could be simplified to just asserting both are districts of the same city, which is already implied by the first premise.
Processed: Error

Generation 4:
TEXT: Xiufeng, Xiangshan, Diecai, Qixing are districts in the city of Guilin.
FOL: DistrictInCity(Xiufeng, Guilin) & DistrictInCity(Xiangshan, Guilin) & DistrictInCity(Diecai, Guilin) & DistrictInCity(Qixing, Guilin)
TEXT: Yangshuo is not a district in Guilin.
FOL: -DistrictInCity(Yangshuo, Guilin)
TEXT: Xiangshan and Diecai are districts in the same city.
FOL: DistrictInCity(Xiangshan, City) & DistrictInCity(Diecai, City)
Given the premises, we know that both Xiangshan and Diecai are districts in Guilin. However, the representation in the conclusion should directly assert the fact based on the provided information without introducing a new variable "City" as Guilin is already specified in the premises.

Corrected:
TEXT: Xiangshan and Diecai are districts in the same city.
FOL: DistrictInCity(Xiangshan, Guilin) & DistrictInCity(Diecai, Guilin)
Processed: True

Generation 5:
TEXT: Xiufeng, Xiangshan, Diecai, Qixing are districts in the city of Guilin.
FOL: District(Xiufeng, Guilin) & District(Xiangshan, Guilin) & District(Diecai, Guilin) & District(Qixing, Guilin)
TEXT: Yangshuo is not a district in Guilin.
FOL: -District(Yangshuo, Guilin)
TEXT: Xiangshan and Diecai are districts in the same city.
FOL: SameCity(District(Xiangshan), District(Diecai))

Note: For the conclusion, we need to express that Xiangshan and Diecai are districts within the same city. Since it is given that they are districts in Guilin, we can infer that they are in the same city (Guilin). However, the expression `SameCity(District(Xiangshan), District(Diecai))` is not directly provided by the NLTK package's logic module syntax. We can infer the same city relationship from the premises directly since they both have the predicate `District(_, Guilin)`. Therefore, the evaluation would implicitly confirm this as true based on the premises given.

TEXT: There is a series by ABC that was developed by the showrunner of Witches of East End.
FOL: exists x. (SeriesByABC(x) & Developed(Showrunner(WitchesOfEastEnd), x))
Note: For the last translation, we assume the Showrunner function returns the individual who is the showrunner of a specified series, here `WitchesOfEastEnd`. However, in the provided premises, there's no explicit need for a function as Maggie Friedman is directly identified as the showrunner. Thus, a more accurate representation might be:
FOL: exists x. (SeriesByABC(x) & Developed(MaggieFriedman, x))

TEXT: There is a series by ABC that was developed by the showrunner of Witches of East End.
FOL: exists x. (SeriesByABC(x) & DevelopedByShowrunnerOfWitchesOfEastEnd(x, MaggieFriedman))

Note: The last expression introduces an existential quantifier to denote the existence of such a series by ABC that matches the condition described in the conclusion. For clarity and consistency with the other expressions, the predicate `DevelopedByShowrunnerOfWitchesOfEastEnd` is used to capture the idea that the series was developed by someone who was a showrunner of "Witches of East End". However, it's important to note that this predicate might need to be further decomposed or defined based on the specific capabilities and limitations of the theorem solver being used.

However, the given conclusion does not logically follow directly from the premises as presented. The premises indicate characteristics of a heptalogy and the structure of two series, but do not provide information that would allow us to definitively state whether "The Chronicles of Narnia" is or is not a heptalogy without making assumptions beyond the premises.

TEXT: The Chronicles of Narnia series of books is not Heptalogy.
FOL: -Heptalogy(ChroniclesOfNarnia)

Note: For simplicity, "DistinctWorks" represents that the series is made up of seven distinct works, and "W1, W2, ..., W7" and "C1, C2, ..., C7" represent the seven distinct works within the Harry Potter series and The Chronicles of Narnia respectively. The definition of "Heptalogy" uses a biconditional statement to link the concept of Heptalogy with having seven distinct works. However, to correctly evaluate this premise, it would be necessary to explicitly state that both "HarryPotterSeries" and "ChroniclesOfNarnia" are instances of "Heptalogy". Given the current premises provided, it does not directly state whether the Chronicles of Narnia is considered a Heptalogy or not. Therefore, based on the given information alone, the conclusion cannot be directly validated or refuted.

However, according to the premises given, the conclusion "The Chronicles of Narnia series of books is not Heptalogy" doesn't logically follow because both premises indicate that "The Chronicles of Narnia" consists of seven distinct works, which aligns with the definition of Heptalogy. Therefore, based on the given premises, one would expect the conclusion to state that "The Chronicles of Narnia" is a Heptalogy rather than not being one.
