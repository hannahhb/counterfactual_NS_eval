If Bonnie either chaperones high school dances or, if she does not, she performs in school talent shows often, then Bonnie is both a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities and an inactive and disinterested member of the community:\n   `Or(ChaperoneHighSchoolDance(Bonnie), Not(PerformSchoolTalentShow(Bonnie) v Often(Bonnie))) -> And(YoungChildOrTeenager(Bonnie), WishToFurtherAcademicCareer(Bonnie), WishToFurtherEducationalOpportunities(Bonnie), DisinterestedCommunityMember(Bonnie))`\n\nTo prove the conclusion, we need to find a situation where Bonnie either chaperones high school dances or does not perform in school talent shows often and is both a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities and an inactive and disinterested member of the community. Since Bonnie is a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities (by assumption), and since all young children and teenagers who wish to further their academic careers and educational opportunities are students who attend the school, we know that Bonnie attends school.\n\nSince Bonnie is a student who attends the school, she cannot chaperone high school dances (from premise 3). Therefore, Bonnie does not chaperone high school dances, and by the premise 2, she performs in school talent shows often or is an inactive and disinterested member of her community. Since Bonnie is a student who attends the school, if she were to be an inactive and disinterested member of her community, she would chaperone high school dances (from premise 4), which we have shown she does not do. Therefore, Bonnie performs in school talent shows often.\n\nSince Bonnie performs in school talent shows often (from the previous step), she attends and is very engaged with school events (from premise 1). Since Bonnie is a student who attends the school, she is not an inactive and disinterested member of her community (from premise 2). Thus, we have shown that Bonnie is both a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities and an active and engaged member of her community.

Then, by premise 7, James is not in the company today (A1). Since James is not in the company, he does not have lunch in the company (L1).

By premise 5, James works remotely from home (R3). Since James is not in the company, he does not have lunch in the company (L4). As there are no other premises related to lunch at home, we cannot conclude whether James has lunch at home (L5). However, we know that James works remotely from home (R3), so he does not neither have lunch at home nor works remotely from home (\u00acL5 \u2227 \u00acR5).\n\nSince both assumptions lead to the conclusion that James neither has lunch at home nor works remotely from home, we have shown that the conclusion follows from the premises.\n\nPredicate/arity map for the conclusion:\n- Or(\u00acL2 \u2227 \u00acR2, \u00acL5 \u2227 \u00acR5)", "FOL:\n<PREMISES>\nAll employees who schedule a meeting with their customers will appear in the company today.\nEveryone who has lunch in the company schedules meetings with their customers.\nEmployees will either have lunch in the company or have lunch at home.\nIf an employee has lunch at home, then he/she is working remotely from home.\nAll employees who are in other countries work remotely from home.\nNo managers work remotely from home.\nJames is either a manager and appears in the company today or neither a manager nor appears in the company today.\n</PREMISES>\n<CONCLUSION>\nIf James is either a manager or in other countries, then James either has lunch at home and works remotely from home, or neither has lunch at home nor works remotely from home.\n</CONCLUSION>\n<EVALUATE>\nPredicate/arity map for the problem:\n['AppearInCompany/1', 'Customer/1', 'Employee/1', 'Lunch/1', 'Meeting/1', 'Manager/1', 'RemoteWork/2', 'SchedulesMeeting/2', 'WorkFromHome/1']\n\nTEXT: All employees who schedule a meeting with their customers will appear in the company today.\nFOL: all x.

The conclusion is that if Rock is cute and still, then Rock is a turtle and skittish. To evaluate this conclusion, we first need to translate the premises into FOL expressions.\n\nThe FOL expressions for the premises are:\n\n1. All rabbits are cute: all x. (Rabbit(x) -> Cute(x))\n2. Some turtles exist: exists x. Turtle(x)\n3. An animal is either a rabbit or a squirrel: all x. (Animal(x) -> (Rabbit(x) | Squirrel(x)))\n4. If something is skittish, then it is not still: all x. (Skittish(x) -> -Still(x))\n5. All squirrels are skittish: all x. (Squirrel(x) -> Skittish(x))\n6. Rock is still: Still(Rock)\n\nTo evaluate the conclusion, we can use these FOL expressions to construct a proof. However, since the conclusion is a conditional statement, we need to prove both the antecedent (Rock is cute and still) and the consequent (Rock is a turtle and skittish).\n\nTo prove the antecedent, we have the following FOL expressions:\n\n1. All rabbits are cute: all x. (Rabbit(x) -> Cute(x))\n2. Rock is not a rabbit (since it's not an animal): -Rabbit(Rock)\n3. Therefore, Rock is not cute by contraposition: -Cute(Rock)\n4. Still(Rock): given in the premises\n\nSince Rock is not cute and it is still, the antecedent of the conclusion is false. Since the consequent of the conclusion is not evaluated, we cannot determine if it follows from the premises.\n\nIn summary, we have shown that if the antecedent of the conclusion is false, then the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises. However, we have not shown that the conclusion is true or false if the antecedent is true. To do so, we would need to evaluate the consequent of the conclusion, which requires proving that Rock is a turtle and skittish, which is not possible given the provided premises."], "answers": ["Uncertain", "Uncertain", "Uncertain", "Uncertain", "Uncertain", "Uncertain", "Error", "Uncertain", "Uncertain", "Uncertain"], "reference": "False", "time_total": 51.00280022621155, "time_llm": 50.94266605377197, "prompt_length": 13236, "majority_reeval": "Uncertain"}

We can start by finding a substitution instance for 'CocoGauff' that makes 'Player(CocoGauff)' true. Since 'CocoGauff' is a specific individual, we can simply use 'CocoGauff' as the substitution instance for 'CocoGauff'.\n\nNext, we need to find a substitution instance for 'CocoGauff' that makes 'RankedHighlyByWTA(CocoGauff)' true. According to the premises, 'RankedHighlyByWTA(X)' is true if and only if 'X' is a player who lost to Iga \u015awi\u0105tek or 'X' is a female tennis player at Roland Garros 2022 who is not a male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022. Since we have already found a substitution instance for 'CocoGauff' that makes 'Player(CocoGauff)' true, we can check whether 'CocoGauff' is a female tennis player at Roland Garros 2022 who is not a male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022.\n\nAccording to the third premise, all female tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 lost to Iga \u015awi\u0105tek. Since 'CocoGauff' is a female tennis player at Roland Garros 2022, we can conclude that 'CocoGauff' lost to Iga \u015awi\u0105tek. Therefore, 'RankedHighlyByWTA(CocoGauff)' is true according to the first premise.\n\nSince we have found a substitution instance that makes both 'Player(CocoGauff)' and 'RankedHighlyByWTA(CocoGauff)' true, we can conclude that the conclusion follows from the premises.", "FOL:\n\n<PREMISES>\n1.
