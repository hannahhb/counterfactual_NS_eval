To evaluate this in FOL, we would need to use logical constructs or predicates to represent the comparison. However, the provided format requires adherence to simple predicates and quantifiers, so the comparison has been represented using the symbol `<=` to indicate the intended meaning. For actual evaluation, a different approach or an extension to FOL might be necessary.\n\nAlso, note that `MonthRent(x) = y` and `MonthRent(x) > y` are not standard FOL expressions due to the nature of FOL not supporting direct numerical comparisons. These should be treated conceptually in the context of the logic being used for evaluation, such as through predefined predicates or relations that encapsulate these conditions.", "<EVALUATE>\nTEXT: Pets are allowed in some managed buildings.\nFOL: exists x.

Each predicate has a clear meaning related to the context of the problem. The expression `exists x.

The condition about Tom renting an apartment is expressed with an equivalence (`<->`) linking his willingness to the conditions of having Fluffy with him and the security deposit being no more than $1500. Since it is stated that $2000 is more than $1500, it suggests that Tom's condition for renting an apartment (with Fluffy and with the deposit no more than $1500) cannot be satisfied at The Olive Garden under these premises, leading to a potential contradiction or an incorrect conclusion.", "TEXT: Pets are allowed in some managed buildings.\nFOL: exists x.
