From the premise \"If and only if Karen binge-watches a Netflix show, she will download it,\" we can infer:\n   - Karen will download \"Stranger Things\" because she binge-watches it.\n3. We know \"Black Mirror\" is a Netflix show but we do not have information about its popularity.\n4. The premise \"Karen does not download 'Black Mirror'\" tells us that Karen did not download \"Black Mirror,\" but it does not give us any information about whether she binge-watched it.\n5. The premise \"If Karen binge-watches a Netflix show, she will share it to Lisa\" only applies if she binge-watches the show.\n\nSince we do not have any information indicating that Karen binge-watches \"Black Mirror,\" we cannot conclude that Karen will share \"Black Mirror\" to Lisa based on the given premises.\n\nTEXT: Karen will share \"Black Mirror\" to Lisa.\nFOL: Share(Karen, \"Black Mirror\", Lisa)\n\nThe conclusion \"Karen will share 'Black Mirror' to Lisa\" does not follow from the given premises.", "TEXT: \"Stranger Things\" is a popular Netflix show.\nFOL: Popular(Show(StrangerThings))\n\nTEXT: If a Netflix show is popular, Karen will binge-watch it.\nFOL: all x.

(MaxDesign(x) -> (Evocative(x) & Dreamy(x)))\n\nNote: In this context, we need to infer the existence of a specific design by Max that is timeless to conclude that it is evocative and dreamy. However, given the premises provided, we cannot directly infer the existence of such a design. We'll evaluate the logical implication based on the given information.\n\nTo evaluate if the conclusion follows from the premises, we will input these FOL expressions into a theorem prover like Prover9.\n\n```python\n# Premises in FOL format\n\npremise1 = \"all x. (ZHD(x) -> Timeless(x))\"\npremise2 = \"all x. (MassProductDesign(x) -> -Timeless(x))\"\npremise3 = \"ZHD(style) | KWD(style)\"\npremise4 = \"all x. (KWD(x) -> Evocative(x))\"\npremise5 = \"all x. (KWD(x) -> Dreamy(x))\"\npremise6 = \"all x. (MaxDesign(x) & Timeless(x) -> (MassProductDesign(x) & Evocative(x)))\"\n\n# Conclusion in FOL format\nconclusion = \"all x. (MaxDesign(x) -> (Evocative(x) & Dreamy(x)))\"\n```\n\nGiven the premises and the conclusion, let's check if the conclusion logically follows using Prover9:\n\n```plaintext\nFOL:\nall x. (ZHD(x) -> Timeless(x))\nall x. (MassProductDesign(x) -> -Timeless(x))\nZHD(style) | KWD(style)\nall x. (KWD(x) -> Evocative(x))\nall x. (KWD(x) -> Dreamy(x))\nall x. (MaxDesign(x) & Timeless(x) -> (MassProductDesign(x) & Evocative(x)))\nall x. (MaxDesign(x) -> (Evocative(x) & Dreamy(x)))\n```\n\nBy inputting these expressions into Prover9, we can determine if the conclusion follows from the premises. The evaluation would typically involve checking if the conclusion can be derived from the premises through logical inference.", "TEXT: All of Zaha Hadid's design styles are timeless.\nFOL: all x.

Let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. No digital media are analog.\n2. Every printed text is analog.\n3. All streaming services are digital.\n4. If an object is a hardcover book then it is printed text.\n5. If 1984 is a streaming service, then 1984 is a hardcover book.\n\nFrom premise 3, if 1984 is a streaming service, then it is digital.\nFrom premise 1 and 2, since digital media cannot be analog, and every printed text is analog, a hardcover book (which includes printed text) cannot be digital.\nThus, if 1984 were a hardcover book, it would have to be analog and not digital, which contradicts premise 3 and premise 5 together. Therefore, the only way to avoid this contradiction is for 1984 not to be a hardcover book. This means that 1984 cannot be a streaming service, as premise 5 suggests.\n\nHence, the conclusion \"1984 is a streaming service\" does not follow from the premises. The correct evaluation in this context would be that the conclusion is false based on the given premises.\n\n```plaintext\nTEXT: 1984 is a streaming service.\nFOL: StreamingService(1984)\n```", "TEXT: No digital media are analog.\nFOL: all x.
