In this case, `NewBirdGenus` represents the concept of discovering a new bird genus, which is implied by the discovery of Ambiortus, a specific prehistoric bird genus. However, since the premises do not provide explicit information about the discovery being 'new', this translation is an interpretation. For exact evaluation, the original statement's exact logical representation in the context of the premises would need to be considered.

FOL: -District(Yangshuo, Guilin)
TEXT: Xiangshan and Diecai are districts in the same city.
FOL: SameCity(District(Xiangshan, Guilin), District(Diecai, Guilin))

Note: The FOL representation for the conclusion assumes a predicate `SameCity` indicating that the entities are in the same city. Given the context, this predicate can be derived from the premise that all mentioned districts (Xiufeng, Xiangshan, Diecai, Qixing) are districts in Guilin. Thus, any two of these districts are in the same city. However, the specific representation may vary based on the exact capabilities and syntax accepted by the theorem prover being used.

FOL: -DistrictInCity(Yangshuo, Guilin)
TEXT: Xiangshan and Diecai are districts in the same city.
FOL: SameCity(DistrictInCity(Xiangshan, Guilin), DistrictInCity(Diecai, Guilin))

However, the expression `SameCity(DistrictInCity(Xiangshan, Guilin), DistrictInCity(Diecai, Guilin))` is not standard FOL syntax, since "same city" is a property inferred from the context rather than a predicate. Given the premises, we know both Xiangshan and Diecai are districts in Guilin, so they are implicitly in the same city. The conclusion should reflect this indirectly through the predicates already defined.

Thus, a correct evaluation could simply assert:
FOL: DistrictInCity(Xiangshan, Guilin) & DistrictInCity(Diecai, Guilin) 

This reflects that both Xiangshan and Diecai are districts in Guilin, which implies they are in the same city without explicitly defining a "same city" relation.

FOL: District(Guilin, Xiufeng) & District(Guilin, Xiangshan) & District(Guilin, Diecai) & District(Guilin, Qixing)
TEXT: Yangshuo is not a district in Guilin.
FOL: -District(Guilin, Yangshuo)
TEXT: Xiangshan and Diecai are districts in the same city.
FOL: SameCity(District(Xiangshan), District(Diecai))

Note: For the conclusion to be represented properly, we have to assume that the "SameCity" predicate is defined to check if two districts belong to the same city. However, this predicate is not directly inferable from the premises using the standard first-order logic predicates provided in the premises. To evaluate the conclusion strictly from the premises, one would need to use the information that both Xiangshan and Diecai are districts of Guilin, thus implicitly indicating they are in the same city. The FOL expression directly derived from premises would not explicitly state that Xiangshan and Diecai are in the same city but can imply it through the common city reference "Guilin". 

Therefore, the conclusion can be indirectly inferred from the premises as:
FOL: District(Guilin, Xiangshan) & District(Guilin, Diecai)

FOL: NumberOfDistinctWorks(ChroniclesOfNarnia, 7)
TEXT: The Chronicles of Narnia series of books is not Heptalogy.
FOL: -Heptalogy(ChroniclesOfNarnia)

Note: The FOL representation assumes the existence of predicates `NumberOfDistinctWorks/2` for counting distinct works in a series and `Heptalogy/1` for determining whether a series is a heptalogy. The logical equivalence `<->` is used in the definition of `Heptalogy` to capture both directions of the relationship between being a compound literary or narrative work consisting of seven distinct works and being a Heptalogy. However, this conclusion does not logically follow from the premises as stated; additional information would be required to establish such a claim, since the premises only indicate that both series consist of seven distinct works, without providing any criterion by which a series might fail to be classified as a Heptalogy despite meeting the numerical requirement.

Generation 1:
TEXT: If two soccer teams score the same number of goals in one UCL final during the regular time, they need to play for the extra time.
FOL: all x. all y. (SoccerTeam(x) & SoccerTeam(y) & Match(x, y, UCLFinal) & GoalsEqual(x, y, RegularTime) -> NeedExtraTime(x, y, UCLFinal))

TEXT: If two soccer teams score the same number of goals in one UCL final during both regular and extra time, they need to play the penalty shoot-out.
FOL: all x. all y. (SoccerTeam(x) & SoccerTeam(y) & Match(x, y, UCLFinal) & GoalsEqual(x, y, RegularTime) & GoalsEqual(x, y, ExtraTime) -> NeedPenaltyShootOut(x, y, UCLFinal))

TEXT: Real Madrid and Atlético Madrid both scored one goal in the 2016 UCL final during the regular time.
FOL: GoalsEqual(RealMadrid, AtleticoMadrid, UCLFinal2016RegularTime)

TEXT: Real Madrid and Atlético Madrid both scored zero goals in the 2016 UCL final during the extra time.
FOL: GoalsEqual(RealMadrid, AtleticoMadrid, UCLFinal2016ExtraTime)

TEXT: Real Madrid and Atlético Madrid did not need to play a penalty shoot-out in the 2016 UCL final.
FOL: -NeedPenaltyShootOut(RealMadrid, AtleticoMadrid, UCLFinal2016)

Note: In the translation, `GoalsEqual` is used to represent the condition where two teams have the same number of goals at a particular stage of the match, and `Match` indicates that two teams are competing in a specific type of game (UCL final). `UCLFinal2016RegularTime` and `UCLFinal2016ExtraTime` are instances that represent the respective stages of the 2016 UCL final between Real Madrid and Atlético Madrid. The predicates `NeedExtraTime` and `NeedPenaltyShootOut` indicate the necessity of playing extra time or penalty shoot-out respectively.

However, to align with the original task and NLTK's logic module capabilities, we would simplify the predicates while ensuring the meanings are preserved:

- `GoalsEqual(x, y, RegularTime)` is simplified to `GoalsEqualRegTime(x, y)`
- `GoalsEqual(x, y, ExtraTime)` is simplified to `GoalsEqualExtTime(x, y)`
- `NeedExtraTime(x, y, UCLFinal)` is simplified to `NeedExtraTime(x, y)`
- `NeedPenaltyShootOut(x, y, UCLFinal)` is simplified to `NeedPenaltyShootOut(x, y)`

Thus, the corrected FOL translations would be:

TEXT: Real Madrid and Atlético Madrid both scored one goal in the 2016 UCL final during the regular time.
FOL: GoalsEqualRegTime(RealMadrid, AtleticoMadrid)

TEXT: Real Madrid and Atlético Madrid both scored zero goals in the 2016 UCL final during the extra time.

Note: For clarity and consistency with the question, I've introduced a predicate `ExistsDifferentCountriesWithOffice` which captures the condition that a company has offices in different countries. This predicate needs to be defined based on the provided premises. Specifically, since Ableton has an office in Germany and in the USA, and these countries are different, we can infer that `ExistsDifferentCountriesWithOffice(Ableton)` is true, leading to the conclusion that `MultinationalCompany(Ableton)` holds true according to the premise given.

TEXT: Alba Roversi uses an Italian surname.
FOL: UsesItalianSurname(AlbaRoversi)

Note: To properly evaluate the last statement, we assume that "UsesItalianSurname" can be inferred from the combination of "UsesSurname" and "ItalianSurname". However, based strictly on the provided premises, "UsesItalianSurname" is not directly supported by any premise in the form presented here. We would need to infer this from the premises, which would involve reasoning steps beyond the direct translation.

TEXT: Alba Roversi uses an Italian surname.
FOL: UsesItalianSurname(AlbaRoversi)

Note: To represent "Alba Roversi uses an Italian surname" accurately in terms of the provided premises, we can infer this from the previous statements. Since Roversi is an Italian surname and Alba Roversi uses Roversi as her surname, we can state:
FOL: UsesItalianSurname(AlbaRoversi) (This is inferred from ItalianSurname(Roversi) & UsesSurname(AlbaRoversi, Roversi))

Note: For the translation of "Alba Roversi uses an Italian surname," I have introduced a new predicate `UsesItalianSurname` to represent this statement clearly. However, based on the premises provided, the predicate could alternatively be directly inferred from existing predicates:
FOL: UsesSurname(AlbaRoversi, Roversi) & ItalianSurname(Roversi) -> UsesItalianSurname(AlbaRoversi)
Processed: True

TEXT: Alba Roversi uses an Italian surname.
FOL: ItalianSurnameUsedBy(AlbaRoversi)

Note: The last FOL expression "ItalianSurnameUsedBy(AlbaRoversi)" was constructed for the purpose of evaluation. The concept of using an Italian surname is derived from combining the premise that "Roversi" is an Italian surname and "Alba Roversi" uses "Roversi" as her surname. However, for formal evaluation purposes, we would need a precise predicate defined in our logical framework that represents the statement "uses an Italian surname."
