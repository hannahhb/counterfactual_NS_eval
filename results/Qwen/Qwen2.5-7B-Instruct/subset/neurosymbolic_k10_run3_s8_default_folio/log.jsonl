ETS also develops K-12 statewide assessments used for accountability testing in many states.\n   - `exists x (Develops(ETS, x) & For(x, K12StateWide) & UsedFor(x, AccountabilityTesting))`\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- ETS develops assessments for K-12 statewide as well as entry to US tertiary and quaternary education institutions.\n  - `exists x (Develops(ETS, x) & (For(x, K12StateWide) & UsedFor(x, AccountabilityTesting) | For(x, TertiaryAndQuaternaryEntryUS))`\n\n### Stage 8: Eighth Problem\n\n**Predicates:**\n- `BRICS/1`\n- `China/1`\n- `EmergingEconomy/1`\n- `From/2`\n- `India/1`\n- `Speak/2`\n\n**Premises:**\n1. China is one of BRICS and its economy is emerging.\n   - `BRICS(China) & EmergingEconomy(China)`\n2. India is one of BRICS and its economy is emerging.\n   - `BRICS(India) & EmergingEconomy(India)`\n3. All people from China speak Chinese.\n   - `forall x (From(x, China) -> Speak(x, Chinese))`\n4.

Six, seven, and eight are real numbers.\n   - `RealNumber(6) & RealNumber(7) & RealNumber(8)`\n2. If a real number equals another real number added by one, the first number is larger.\n   - `forall x y (RealNumber(x) & RealNumber(y) & Equals(x, y + 1) -> LargerThan(x, y))`\n3. If the number x is larger than the number y, then y is not larger than x.\n   - `forall x y (RealNumber(x) & RealNumber(y) & LargerThan(x, y) -> ~LargerThan(y, x))`\n4. Seven equals six plus one.\n   - `Equals(7, 6 + 1)`\n5. Eight equals seven plus one.\n   - `Equals(8, 7 + 1)`\n6. Two is positive.\n   - `Positive(2)`\n7. If a number is positive, then the double of it is also positive.\n   - `forall x (Positive(x) -> Positive(double(x)))`\n8. Eight is the double of four.\n   - `Equals(8, 2 * 4)`\n9. Four is the double of two.\n   - `Equals(4, 2 * 2)`\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Eight is larger than seven.\n  - `LargerThan(8, 7)`\n\nThese FOL expressions can now be evaluated using a theorem prover like Prover9 to check if the conclusions follow from the premises. \n\n<PREMISES>\nAll dispensable things are environment-friendly.\nAll woodware is dispensable.\nAll paper is woodware.\nNo good things are bad.\nAll environment-friendly things are good.\nA worksheet is either paper or is environment-friendly.\n</PREMISES>\n<CONCLUSION>\nA worksheet is not dispensable.\n</CONCLUSION>\n<EVALUATE>\nPredicate/arity map for the problem: \n ['Bad/1', 'Dispensable/1', 'EnvironmentFriendly/1', 'Good/1', 'Paper/1', 'Woodware/1']TEXT: All dispensable things are environment-friendly. \nFOL: all x.

Real Madrid and Atl\u00e9tico Madrid both scored one goal in the 2016 UCL final during the regular time.\n   - `Scored(RealMadrid, Atl\u00e9ticoMadrid, RegularTime(UCLFinal(2016))) \u2227 GoalNumber(RealMadrid, RegularTime(UCLFinal(2016))) = 1`\n   - `Scored(Atl\u00e9ticoMadrid, RealMadrid, RegularTime(UCLFinal(2016))) \u2227 GoalNumber(Atl\u00e9ticoMadrid, RegularTime(UCLFinal(2016))) = 1`\n\n4.
