(ZooBear(x) -> -Wild(x))\n\nTEXT: Some bears are in zoos.\nFOL: exists x. ZooBear(x)\n\nTEXT: Not all bears are wild.\nFOL: -all x. Wild(x)\n\nLet's evaluate these expressions using a theorem prover like Prover9.\n\n### Step-by-Step Evaluation:\n\n1. **Translate Premises and Conclusion:**\n   - All bears in zoos are not wild.\n     \\[\n     \\forall x. (ZooBear(x) \\rightarrow \\neg Wild(x))\n     \\]\n   - Some bears are in zoos.\n     \\[\n     \\exists x. ZooBear(x)\n     \\]\n   - Not all bears are wild.\n     \\[\n     \\neg \\forall x. Wild(x)\n     \\]\n\n2. **Negate the Conclusion:**\n   The negation of \"Not all bears are wild\" is \"All bears are wild.\"\n   \\[\n   \\forall x. Wild(x)\n   \\]\n\n3. **Formulate the Problem for Prover9:**\n   We need to check if the premises imply the negation of the conclusion. This means we need to see if the conjunction of the premises and the negation of the conclusion leads to a contradiction.\n\n4. **Input to Prover9:**\n   The input to Prover9 would look like this:\n   ```\n   formulae( axioms ).\n   { all x. (ZooBear(x) -> -Wild(x)) }.\n   { exists x. ZooBear(x) }.\n   { all x. Wild(x) }.\n   end_of_list.\n\n   formulae( queries ).\n   { not }.\n   end_of_list.\n   ```\n\n5. **Run Prover9:**\n   When you run Prover9 with the above input, it will attempt to prove the negation of the conclusion. If it fails to prove it, then the original conclusion is valid.\n\n6. **Interpret Prover9 Output:**\n   If Prover9 returns a contradiction, it means the premises imply the original conclusion. If it does not return a contradiction, it means the premises do not necessarily imply the conclusion.\n\n### Prover9 Analysis:\nWhen running the above input through Prover9, you will find that the system cannot derive a contradiction from the premises and the negation of the conclusion. Therefore, the premises do not imply the negation of the conclusion, meaning the original conclusion \"Not all bears are wild\" is valid.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, the conclusion \"Not all bears are wild\" follows from the premises."], "answers": ["True", "True", "Error", "True", "True", "True", "True", "True", "True", "True"], "reference": "True", "time_total": 46.04857683181763, "time_llm": 46.01829767227173, "prompt_length": 7379}

(Mammal(x) \\land LaysEggs(x) \\rightarrow (Platypus(x) \\lor Echidna(x)))\n   \\]\n\n2. **Platypuses are not hyrax.**\n   \\[\n   \\forall x .

(Grebe(x) \\rightarrow \\neg Echidna(x))\n   \\]\n\nNow, we need to evaluate whether \"Hyraxes lay eggs\" follows from these premises. From the first premise, since hyraxes are mammals and no mammal lays eggs unless it is a platypus or an echidna, and we know hyraxes are neither, hyraxes do not lay eggs.\n\nThus, the conclusion \"Hyraxes lay eggs\" does not logically follow from the given premises.\n\n**FOL Representation:**\n\n\\[\n\\text{FOL: } \\neg LaysEggs(Hyrax)\n\\]\n\nThis can be used as input for a theorem solver like Prover9 to verify.", "TEXT: The only types of mammals that lay eggs are either platypuses or echidnas.\nFOL: all x.

(Volunteer(x) -> IntangibleBenefits(x))`, we know that every volunteer receives intangible benefits for their work.\n   - The premise `NaturalDisasterResponse -> AsNeededWork(GroupWork(NaturalDisasterResponse))` tells us that participating in natural disaster response involves working in groups on an as-needed basis.\n   - However, the fact that natural disaster response involves group work does not directly link back to the fact that volunteers receive intangible benefits.\n\n4. **Checking Consistency:**\n   - Since `Volunteer(x) -> IntangibleBenefits(x)` is a universal statement, if `x` is a volunteer, `x` will receive intangible benefits regardless of how they are working (regularly, as-needed, in groups, or individually).\n   - The specific activity of natural disaster response being an example of group work on an as-needed basis does not change the fact that volunteers in general receive intangible benefits.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion `Volunteer(NaturalDisasterResponse) -> IntangibleBenefits(NaturalDisasterResponse)` logically follows from the premises. \n\nSo, the final evaluation result is:\n**The conclusion \"Volunteers who participate in natural disaster response receive intangible benefits for their work\" follows from the premises.**", "TEXT: All volunteers receive intangible benefits for their work.\nFOL: all x.

(ImportantScientificAchievement(x) -> UsInvention(x))  # Conclusion\n```\n\nWhen we input these into Prover9 and attempt to derive the conclusion, Prover9 will return a result indicating whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises. Let's proceed with the evaluation:\n\n```plaintext\n% Input for Prover9\n\nformulas(arity).\nArity(0, 0). % No constant or function symbols\nArity(1, 4). % ArtificialSatellite, ImportantScientificAchievement, UsInvention, Worksheet\nArity(2, 0). % No binary predicate or function symbols needed in this case\n\nformulas(kind).\nKind(Arity(1,4), predicate). % Arity for predicates\n\nformulas(sort).\nSort(ArtificialSatellite, 1).\nSort(ImportantScientificAchievement, 1).\nSort(UsInvention, 1).\n\nformulas(assumption).\nall x.

Based on logical analysis, we can see that the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises. Here's why:\n\n1. The first premise states that all artificial satellites are important scientific achievements.\n2. The second premise states that some artificial satellites are not U.S. inventions.\n\nHowever, the conclusion claims that all important scientific achievements are U.S. inventions. This would mean that no important scientific achievement can be an artificial satellite unless it is a U.S. invention, which contradicts the second premise.\n\nThus, Prover9 should fail to derive the conclusion from the given premises, confirming that the conclusion does not logically follow.", "TEXT: All artificial satellites are important scientific achievements.\nFOL: all x.

Therefore, it is impossible for all important scientific achievements to be U.S. inventions because there exists at least one counterexample.\n\nThus, the conclusion does not follow from the premises.

This directly contradicts the conclusion that White Town did not produce any popular songs.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, the conclusion does not follow.\n\nLet's use Prover9 to formalize and check this reasoning:\n\n```", "TEXT: \"Your Woman\" is a song by the British one-person band White Town.\nFOL: isSongBy(\"Your Woman\", WhiteTown) & BandType(WhiteTown, OnePerson)\n\nTEXT: \"Your Woman\" song peaked at No. 1 on the UK Singles Chart.\nFOL: PeakedAtNo1(\"Your Woman\", UKSinglesChart)\n\nTEXT: If a song peaked at No.1 at a particular place, it was extremely popular.\nFOL: all x. all y.

(-isSongBy(x, WhiteTown) | -Popular(x, UKSinglesChart))\n  \nThis last statement needs clarification because we need to express that no songs produced by White Town are popular. We need to ensure that if a song is popular, it cannot be produced by White Town.\n\nCorrected FOL for the conclusion:\nTEXT: White Town did not produce any popular songs.\nFOL: all x.

According to the second premise: `ScoreSameGoalsRegularAndExtraTime(RealMadrid, Atl\u00e9ticoMadrid) -> NeedPenaltyShootOut(RealMadrid, Atl\u00e9ticoMadrid)`. However, since we do not have the condition `ScoreSameGoalsRegularAndExtraTime(RealMadrid, Atl\u00e9ticoMadrid)`, we cannot conclude `NeedPenaltyShootOut(RealMadrid, Atl\u00e9ticoMadrid)` directly from this premise.\n5. Since `NeedExtraTime(RealMadrid, Atl\u00e9ticoMadrid)` is true, they did not need to play the penalty shoot-out.\n\nTherefore, based on the premises, the conclusion \"Real Madrid and Atl\u00e9tico Madrid did not need to play a penalty shoot-out in the 2016 UCL final\" is correct.\n\nHere is the evaluation in the required format:\n\nTEXT: If two soccer teams score the same number of goals in one UCL final during the regular time, they need to play for the extra time.\nFOL: all x all y.

The conclusion contradicts one of the premises, making the problem unsound or contradictory. \n\nLet's evaluate the logic using the given premises:\n\n- We know that Ableton has offices in both Germany and the USA.\n- Since these are different countries, Ableton is a multinational company according to the definition provided.\n- The conclusion states that Ableton does not have an office in Germany, which directly contradicts Premise 1.\n\nSince the conclusion contradicts a premise, it cannot logically follow from the premises.

This directly contradicts the first premise, which states that Ableton has an office in Germany. Therefore, the conclusion cannot be true based on the given premises.\n\nThus, the conclusion \"Ableton does not have an office in Germany\" does not follow from the premises.

(GetFlu(x) -> FeelTired(x))`\n\n7. **Conclusion**: There is an animal.\n   - FOL: `exists x. (Animal(x))`\n\n### Evaluation:\nTo determine whether the conclusion \"There is an animal\" follows from the premises, we need to check if the existential statement `exists x. (Animal(x))` can be derived from the given premises using a theorem prover like Prover9.\n\n- Premises establish relationships and conditions but do not directly assert the existence of an animal. The premise `exists x. (Animal(x) & MonkeypoxVirusOccursIn(x))` indirectly suggests the existence of an animal since it states that the monkeypox virus can occur in certain animals, implying that there must be at least one animal.\n\nGiven this setup, the conclusion `exists x. (Animal(x))` should logically follow from the premises, as the existence of an animal is implied by the occurrence of the monkeypox virus in certain animals.\n\nTo confirm this with a theorem prover, you would input these statements and see if Prover9 can derive the conclusion.", "TEXT: When the Monkeypox virus occurs in a being, it may get Monkeypox.\nFOL: all x.

(Platypus(x) -> (Mammal(x) & -HasTeeth(x)))\nHowever, since we need to represent \"some mammals have teeth,\" we will keep that as an existential statement. The conclusion will directly assert that platypuses are mammals with no teeth.\n\nTo evaluate this, we can use the following FOL expressions:\n\n```", "TEXT: Some mammals have teeth.\nFOL: exists x. (Mammal(x) & HasTeeth(x))\n\nTEXT: Platypuses have no teeth.\nFOL: all x. (Platypus(x) -> -HasTeeth(x))\n\nTEXT: Platypuses are mammals.\nFOL: all x.

(Platypus(x) -> (Mammal(x) & -HasTeeth(x)))\nHowever, to properly evaluate whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises, we need to ensure that our FOL expressions correctly capture the relationships and constraints provided in the premises. The expression for the conclusion should combine the information about Platypuses being mammals and having no teeth.\n\nGiven the premises, we can represent the conclusion as:\n\nTEXT: Platypuses are mammals with no teeth.\nFOL: all x.

(Platypus(x) -> (Mammal(x) & -HasTeeth(x)))\nHowever, the premise \"Some mammals have teeth\" does not provide enough information to conclude the specific statement about platypuses directly. Let's break down the premises and see if we can derive the conclusion.\n\nGiven:\n1. `exists x. (Mammal(x) & HasTeeth(x))` (Some mammals have teeth)\n2. `all x. (Platypus(x) -> -HasTeeth(x))` (Platypuses have no teeth)\n3. `all x. (Platypus(x) -> Mammal(x))` (Platypuses are mammals)\n\nFrom these, we can deduce:\n4. For any platypus `p`, since `Platypus(p)` implies `Mammal(p)` (from premise 3), and `Platypus(p)` also implies `-HasTeeth(p)` (from premise 2), we can combine these to get:\n   `all x. (Platypus(x) -> (Mammal(x) & -HasTeeth(x)))` (Platypuses are mammals with no teeth)\n\nSo, the conclusion is valid based on the given premises. The final FOL expression is:\n\nFOL: all x.

Let's break down the reasoning:\n\n1. **Premise Analysis:**\n   - Mammals that lay eggs are either platypuses or echidnas.\n   - Platypuses and echidnas are not hyraxes.\n   - No mammal is an invertebrate.\n   - All animals are either vertebrates or invertebrates.\n   - Mammals are animals.\n   - Hyraxes are mammals.\n   - Grebes lay eggs and are not platypuses or echidnas.\n   \n2. **Logical Deduction:**\n   - Since grebes lay eggs and are neither platypuses nor echidnas, they must be a different type of egg-laying mammal (if such a thing exists), but the premise states that the only egg-laying mammals are platypuses or echidnas.\n   - Therefore, grebes cannot be mammals because the only egg-laying mammals are platypuses and echidnas, and grebes are explicitly stated not to be platypuses or echidnas.\n   \nFrom the above analysis, the conclusion \"Grebes are not mammals\" logically follows from the given premises.\n\n**Final FOL Representation for Evaluation:**\n\nTEXT: The only types of mammals that lay eggs are either platypuses or echidnas.\nFOL: (Mammal(x) & LaysEggs(x)) -> (Platypus(x) | Echidna(x))\n\nTEXT: Platypuses are not hyrax.\nFOL: (Platypus(x) -> -Hyrax(x))\n\nTEXT: Echidnas are not hyrax.\nFOL: (Echidna(x) -> -Hyrax(x))\n\nTEXT: No mammals are invertebrates.\nFOL: (Mammal(x) -> -Invertebrate(x))\n\nTEXT: All animals are either vertebrates or invertebrates.\nFOL: (Animal(x) -> (Vertebrate(x) | Invertebrate(x)))\n\nTEXT: Mammals are animals.\nFOL: (Mammal(x) -> Animal(x))\n\nTEXT: Hyraxes are mammals.\nFOL: (Hyrax(x) -> Mammal(x))\n\nTEXT: Grebes lay eggs.\nFOL: (Grebe(x) -> LaysEggs(x))\n\nTEXT: Grebes are not platypuses and also not echidnas.\nFOL: (Grebe(x) -> -Platypus(x)) & (Grebe(x) -> -Echidna(x))\n\nTEXT: Grebes are not mammals.\nFOL: (Grebe(x) -> -Mammal(x))", "TEXT: The only types of mammals that lay eggs are either platypuses or echidnas.\nFOL: all x.

(Grebe(x) \\rightarrow - (Platypus(x) \\lor Echidna(x)))\n      \\]\n\n2. **Conclusion:**\n    - We need to determine if \"Grebes are not mammals\" follows logically from these premises.\n\n3. **Evaluating the Conclusion:**\n    - Given that grebes lay eggs (\\(LaysEggs(Grebe)\\)), from the premise \"The only types of mammals that lay eggs are either platypuses or echidnas,\" we know:\n      \\[\n      LaysEggs(Grebe) \\rightarrow (Platypus(Grebe) \\lor Echidna(Grebe))\n      \\]\n    - But we also have that \"Grebes are not platypuses and also not echidnas\":\n      \\[\n      \\neg (Platypus(Grebe) \\lor Echidna(Grebe))\n      \\]\n    - This creates a contradiction because \\(LaysEggs(Grebe)\\) implies \\(Platypus(Grebe) \\lor Echidna(Grebe)\\), but \\(\\neg (Platypus(Grebe) \\lor Echidna(Grebe))\\) directly contradicts it.\n\n4. **Final Analysis:**\n    - Since there is a direct contradiction in the premises regarding the possibility of grebes laying eggs while being neither platypuses nor echidnas, the premises themselves are inconsistent.\n\nTherefore, given the inconsistency in the premises, it is impossible to definitively conclude anything about whether grebes are mammals or not based on the given information. However, if we strictly follow the logical structure and derive the necessary conclusions from the provided premises, the logical flow indicates that the conclusion \"Grebes are not mammals\" does not hold due to the inherent contradiction in the premises.\n\nThus, the conclusion \"Grebes are not mammals\" does not logically follow from the given premises.", "TEXT: The only types of mammals that lay eggs are either platypuses or echidnas.\nFOL: all x.

(ArtPiece(x) -> RequiresTalent(x))\nFOL: all x. (RequiresTalent(x) -> RequiresPractice(x))\nFOL: exists x. (ArtPiece(x) & -RequiresPractice(x))\n```\n\nWe will use Prover9 to check if the conclusion follows from the premises. Here is how you would typically set up the input for Prover9:\n\n```\nformulas(assum).\n  -all x. (ArtPiece(x) -> RequiresTalent(x)).\n  all x. (RequiresTalent(x) -> RequiresPractice(x)).\nend_of_list.\n\nformulas(qed).\n  exists x. (ArtPiece(x) & -RequiresPractice(x)).\nend_of_list.\n```\n\nWhen you run this input through Prover9, you should get a result indicating whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises. If the proof succeeds, it means the conclusion does follow; if it fails, it does not.\n\nGiven the nature of the premises and the conclusion, we can reason as follows:\n\n1. The first premise states that not all art pieces require talent.\n2. The second premise states that anything that requires talent also requires practice.\n3. From these, we can infer that there must be art pieces that do not require talent (and thus cannot require practice).\n\nTherefore, based on logical reasoning, the conclusion \"There exist art pieces that do not require practice\" should indeed follow from the given premises.", "TEXT: Not all art pieces require talent.\nFOL: -all x.

From the premises, we know:\n   - Douglas Adams is an author, and therefore a writer.\n   - The Salmon of Doubt is written by Douglas Adams.\n   - All authors are writers, and writers create innovative ideas.\n\n2.

From the premise \"Writers create innovative ideas\" (FOL: all x. (Writer(x) -> CreatesInnovativeIdeas(x))), and knowing that Douglas Adams is a writer, we can infer that Douglas Adams creates innovative ideas.\n3. Since Douglas Adams created The Salmon of Doubt, and he creates innovative ideas, it follows that The Salmon of Doubt contains innovative ideas.\n4. However, the premise \"Some books that contain innovative ideas are about technology\" does not provide specific information about The Salmon of Doubt being one of these books.\n5. The final premise \"The Salmon of Doubt is about life experiences and technology\" (FOL: AboutLifeExperiencesAndTechnology(TheSalmonofDoubt)) indicates that the book touches on technology, but this alone does not guarantee that it contains innovative ideas.\n6. Given the information provided, it cannot be definitively concluded that The Salmon of Doubt does not contain innovative ideas.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"The Salmon of Doubt has no innovative ideas\" does not logically follow from the premises. The premises suggest that The Salmon of Doubt likely contains innovative ideas, given that it is a book by an author (and thus a writer) who creates such ideas.", "TEXT: Douglas Adams is an author who created the book collection called The Salmon of Doubt.\nFOL: Author(DouglasAdams) & CreatedBy(DouglasAdams, TheSalmonOfDoubt)\n\nTEXT: The Salmon of Doubt is about life experiences and technology.\nFOL: AboutLifeExperiencesAndTechnology(TheSalmonOfDoubt)\n\nTEXT: All authors are writers.\nFOL: all x.

From the premise \"The Salmon of Doubt is about life experiences and technology,\" we know that the book covers both life experiences and technology.\n2. From the premise \"All authors are writers\" and \"Writers create innovative ideas,\" we know that since Douglas Adams is an author, he is also a writer, and as a writer, he creates innovative ideas.\n3. Since Douglas Adams created The Salmon of Doubt, and writers create innovative ideas, it logically follows that The Salmon of Doubt contains innovative ideas.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the conclusion \"The Salmon of Doubt has no innovative ideas\" contradicts the premises. Therefore, the conclusion does not follow from the given premises.\n\nTo formalize this in FOL for Prover9, you would input the premises and the negation of the conclusion and check if it leads to a contradiction.

The premise states that the Mona Lisa is a world's best-known painting and it is also a portrait. Therefore, the conclusion does not follow from the premises.\n\nLet's re-evaluate this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Premise 1**: BestKnownArtwork(MonaLisa)\n2. **Premise 2**: Portrait(MonaLisa)\n3. **Premise 3**: PainterByLeonardoDaVinci(MonaLisa) (This premise is not directly relevant to the conclusion but confirms that the Mona Lisa was painted by Leonardo da Vinci.)\n4. **Premise 4**: GenresOfPainting = {History, Portrait, Animal, Landscape, StillLife} (This provides context about the types of paintings but does not affect the conclusion directly.)\n\nGiven these premises, we know that the Mona Lisa is both a best-known artwork and a portrait.

The correct FOL representation would be:\n\nTEXT: No world's best-known artworks are portraits.\nFOL: \\(\\neg\\, \\exists x.

Therefore, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.\n\nLet's formalize this reasoning:\n\n- From the premises, we have: `WorldBestKnownPainting(MonaLisa)` and `Portrait(MonaLisa)`.\n- The conclusion is: `all x. (WorldBestKnownArtwork(x) -> -Portrait(x))`.\n\nSince `MonaLisa` is a counterexample where `WorldBestKnownArtwork(MonaLisa)` is true and `Portrait(MonaLisa)` is true, the statement `all x. (WorldBestKnownArtwork(x) -> -Portrait(x))` cannot hold true under these conditions.\n\nThus, the conclusion \"No world's best-known artworks are portraits\" does not logically follow from the premises.", "TEXT: The Mona Lisa is a world's best-known painting.\nFOL: WorldBestKnownArtwork(MonaLisa)\n\nTEXT: The Mona Lisa is a portrait painted by Leonardo da Vinci.\nFOL: Portrait(Painting(MonaLisa)) & PainterOf(Painting(MonaLisa), LeonardoDaVinci)\n\nTEXT: Leonardo da Vinci was a scientist and painter.\nFOL: Scientist(LeonardoDaVinci) & Painter(LeonardoDaVinci)\n\nTEXT: Painting genres can be history, portrait, animal, landscape, and still life.\nFOL: all x.

(Hatchery(x) -> OpenToVisitors(x))`\nfollows from the premises.\n\nLet's translate this into Prover9 input format:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the predicates\nhatchery(X).\nopen_to_visitors(X).\nfor_profit(X).\nfor_conservation(X).\nmight_release_animals_wild(X).\n\n% Premises\nhatchery(national_lobster_hatchery).\nopen_to_visitors(national_lobster_hatchery).\nforall(X, (hatchery(X) -> (for_profit(X) | for_conservation(X))).\nforall(X, (hatchery(X) & for_conservation(X) -> might_release_animals_wild(X)).\nnot for_profit(national_lobster_hatchery).\n\n% Conclusion\nforall(X, (hatchery(X) -> open_to_visitors(X)).\n\n% Query\nprove forall(X, (hatchery(X) -> open_to_visitors(X)).\n```\n\nWhen you run this through Prover9, it will attempt to prove the conclusion from the given premises. If Prover9 can derive the conclusion from the premises, then the conclusion logically follows from the premises. If not, the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises.\n\nLet's break down why the conclusion may not follow:\n\n1. We know that `NationalLobsterHatchery` is a hatchery and it is open to visitors.\n2. We also know that `NationalLobsterHatchery` is not for profit, which means it must be for conservation.\n3. Therefore, based on the premises, `NationalLobsterHatchery` might release animals into the wild.\n\nHowever, the premises do not provide any information about other hatcheries being open to visitors. The fact that `NationalLobsterHatchery` is open to visitors does not imply that all hatcheries are open to visitors. Thus, the conclusion \"all hatcheries are open to visitors\" cannot be derived from the given premises.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.", "TEXT: The National Lobster Hatchery is a hatchery located in Padstow, England.\nFOL: (Hatchery(NationalLobsterHatchery) & LocatedIn(NationalLobsterHatchery, \"Padstow\", \"England\"))\n\nTEXT: The National Lobster Hatchery is open to visitors.\nFOL: OpenToVisitors(NationalLobsterHatchery)\n\nTEXT: A hatchery is either for profit or for conservation.\nFOL: all x.

(Hatchery(x) -> OpenToVisitors(x))\n\nTEXT: Conclusion: All hatcheries are open to visitors.\nFOL: all x. (Hatchery(x) -> OpenToVisitors(x))\n\nTo determine if the conclusion follows from the premises, we would input these FOL expressions into a theorem prover like Prover9 and see if the system can derive the conclusion from the premises.\n\nHere\u2019s how the input might look for Prover9:\n\n```prolog\nall x. (Hatchery(x) -> (ForProfit(x) | ForConservation(x)))\nall x.

(Hatchery(x) -> OpenToVisitors(x))\n```\n\nGiven the premises, we can simplify the logic to determine if the conclusion holds. However, since the conclusion states \"all hatcheries are open to visitors,\" and only one specific hatchery (National Lobster Hatchery) is mentioned as being open to visitors, we need to check if this implies the general statement about all hatcheries.\n\nFrom the premise:\n- We know that the National Lobster Hatchery is a hatchery and is open to visitors.\n- We also know that a hatchery is either for profit or for conservation.\n- The National Lobster Hatchery is not for profit, so it must be for conservation.\n- Since it is for conservation, it might release animals into the wild, but this does not contradict its being open to visitors.\n\nHowever, the premises do not provide enough information to conclude that **all** hatcheries are open to visitors. Therefore, based on the given premises, the conclusion does not logically follow.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n**The conclusion \"All hatcheries are open to visitors\" does not logically follow from the given premises.**"], "answers": ["Uncertain", "Uncertain", "Uncertain", "Uncertain", "Uncertain", "True", "Uncertain", "Uncertain", "Uncertain", "True"], "reference": "Uncertain", "time_total": 131.8291621208191, "time_llm": 131.773202419281, "prompt_length": 7637}

The current translation uses existential quantifiers, but for a direct evaluation of logical implications, we typically use universal quantifiers for the premises and handle the existential quantifier in the conclusion.\n\nLet's reformulate the premises and conclusion:\n\nTEXT: Some fears lead to anxiety.\nFOL: exists x.

The existence of fears leading to anxiety and anxiety leading to terror does not necessarily imply that there is no direct path from fears to terror. Therefore, the conclusion \"No fears lead to terror\" does not logically follow from the given premises.\n\nIn summary, the conclusion \"No fears lead to terror\" does not follow from the premises.", "TEXT: Some fears lead to anxiety.\nFOL: exists x.

However, since we are translating the statements here, let's reason through it:\n\n1. The premises state that there exist some fears that lead to anxiety and some anxiety that leads to terror. This means:\n   - There is at least one fear (let's call it Fear1) such that Fear1 leads to Anxiety1.\n   - There is at least one anxiety (let's call it Anxiety2) such that Anxiety2 leads to Terror2.\n\n2. The conclusion states that no fears lead to terror.\n\nGiven the premises:\n- We know there are some fears that lead to anxiety.\n- We also know that there are some anxieties that lead to terror.\n- However, the premises do not specify any direct connection between fears and terror, other than via anxiety.\n\nFrom this, we cannot logically conclude that no fears lead to terror. The existence of fears leading to anxiety and anxiety leading to terror does not necessarily mean that fears cannot directly or indirectly lead to terror through other pathways not specified in the premises.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, the conclusion \"No fears lead to terror\" does not follow logically. The correct translation of the conclusion in FOL is:\nFOL: all x.

Here's how you would structure the input for Prover9:\n\n```", "TEXT: The Turing Award has been awarded to Donald Knuth, Marvin Minsky, Richard Hamming, and John McCarthy.\nFOL: TuringAward(DonaldKnuth) & TuringAward(MarvinMinsky) & TuringAward(RichardHamming) & TuringAward(JohnMcCarthy)\n\nTEXT: Donald Knuth made contributions to the analysis of algorithms.\nFOL: AnalysisOfAlgorithms(DonaldKnuth)\n\nTEXT: Marvin Minsky is recognized for his contributions to the field of artificial intelligence.\nFOL: ArtificialIntelligence(MarvinMinsky)\n\nTEXT: Richard Hamming researched numerical methods.\nFOL: NumericalMethods(RichardHamming)\n\nTEXT: John McCarthy made contributions to the field of artificial intelligence.\nFOL: ArtificialIntelligence(JohnMcCarthy)\n\nTEXT: Only one person who won the Turing Award made significant contributions to the analysis of algorithms.\nFOL: exactly_one(x.

We need to reformulate the statement using a different approach. One way to handle this is by using a conjunction of all possible pairs and their negations to ensure only one person wins the award for the analysis of algorithms. This can get quite complex, but here's a simplified version focusing on the key individuals:\n\n```\n% Premises\nTuringAward(DonaldKnuth)\nTuringAward(MarvinMinsky)\nTuringAward(RichardHamming)\nTuringAward(JohnMcCarthy)\nAnalysisOfAlgorithms(DonaldKnuth)\nArtificialIntelligence(MarvinMinsky)\nNumericalMethods(RichardHamming)\nArtificialIntelligence(JohnMcCarthy)\n\n% Conclusion\nAnalysisOfAlgorithms(DonaldKnuth) & -AnalysisOfAlgorithms(MarvinMinsky) & -AnalysisOfAlgorithms(RichardHamming) & -AnalysisOfAlgorithms(JohnMcCarthy)\n```\n\nThis formulation ensures that if Donald Knuth is the only one contributing to the analysis of algorithms, then the other three cannot also make such contributions. If the conclusion holds true in this setup, it implies that only Donald Knuth made significant contributions to the analysis of algorithms.\n\nLet's use Prover9 to check this:\n\n```prolog\n% Premises\nTuringAward(DonaldKnuth).\nTuringAward(MarvinMinsky).\nTuringAward(RichardHamming).\nTuringAward(JohnMcCarthy).\nAnalysisOfAlgorithms(DonaldKnuth).\nArtificialIntelligence(MarvinMinsky).\nNumericalMethods(RichardHamming).\nArtificialIntelligence(JohnMcCarthy).\n\n% Conclusion\nAnalysisOfAlgorithms(DonaldKnuth) & -AnalysisOfAlgorithms(MarvinMinsky) & -AnalysisOfAlgorithms(RichardHamming) & -AnalysisOfAlgorithms(JohnMcCarthy).\n```\n\nRunning this in Prover9 should confirm whether the conclusion follows from the premises.", "TEXT: The Turing Award has been awarded to Donald Knuth, Marvin Minsky, Richard Hamming, and John McCarthy.\nFOL: WonTuringAward(DonaldKnuth) & WonTuringAward(MarvinMinsky) & WonTuringAward(RichardHamming) & WonTuringAward(JohnMcCarthy)\n\nTEXT: Donald Knuth made contributions to the analysis of algorithms.\nFOL: MadeContributions(DonaldKnuth, AnalysisOfAlgorithms)\n\nTEXT: Marvin Minsky is recognized for his contributions to the field of artificial intelligence.\nFOL: MadeContributions(MarvinMinsky, ArtificialIntelligence)\n\nTEXT: Richard Hamming researched numerical methods.\nFOL: MadeContributions(RichardHamming, NumericalMethods)\n\nTEXT: John McCarthy made contributions to the field of artificial intelligence.\nFOL: MadeContributions(JohnMcCarthy, ArtificialIntelligence)\n\nTEXT: Only one person who won the Turing Award made significant contributions to the analysis of algorithms.\nFOL: all x. all y.

Let's break down the evaluation step-by-step:\n\n1. **Premise 1**: If something can transport multiple passengers, then they are not one-seaters.\n   - \\( \\forall x.

From `all x. (TeslaModel3(x) -> CanTransportMultiplePassengers(x))`, we know that Tesla Model 3 cars can transport multiple passengers.\n2. From `all x. (CanTransportMultiplePassengers(x) -> -OneSeater(x))`, we know that anything that can transport multiple passengers cannot be a one-seater.\n3. From `all x. (SingleSeatElectricCar(x) -> OneSeater(x))` and `all x. (SoloEV(x) -> SingleSeatElectricCar(x))`, we know that all Solo EV cars are single-seat electric cars, and all single-seat electric cars are one-seaters.\n4. From `(\u00acTeslaModel3(JohnsCar) -> \u00acTeslaModel3(JohnsCar) | \u00acSingleSeatElectricCar(JohnsCar))`, if John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, then it must be a single-seat electric car (since the disjunction `\u00acTeslaModel3(JohnsCar) | \u00acSingleSeatElectricCar(JohnsCar)` would hold true only if John's car is a single-seat electric car).\n\nGiven that a single-seat electric car is a one-seater, and a one-seater cannot transport multiple passengers, if John's car were a single-seat electric car, it could not be a Tesla Model 3 (because a Tesla Model 3 can transport multiple passengers). Therefore, for the statement `(\u00acTeslaModel3(JohnsCar) -> \u00acTeslaModel3(JohnsCar) | \u00acSingleSeatElectricCar(JohnsCar))` to hold, John's car must be a Tesla Model 3.\n\nHence, the conclusion \"John's car is a Tesla Model 3\" follows logically from the premises.", "TEXT: If something can transport multiple passengers, then they are not one-seaters.\nFOL: all x.
