First, you need to convert the premises and conclusion into Prover9 format. Here's an example of how you can do that:\n\nFOL expressions:\n1. (\u2200x (RealNumber(x) \u2227 RealNumber(y) \u27f9 (x = y + 1) \u27f9 Larger(x, y)))\n2. (\u2200x (Larger(x, y) \u27f9 -(Larger(y, x))))\n3. (RealNumber(6) \u2227 RealNumber(7) \u2227 RealNumber(8))\n4. (7 = 6 + 1)\n5. (8 = 7 + 1)\n6. Positive(2)\n7. (\u2200x (Positive(x) \u27f9 Positive(2 * x)))\n8. (8 = 4 * 2)\n9. (4 = 2 * 2)\n10. Larger(8, 7)\n\nProver9 format:\n1. (implies (and (RealNumber x) (RealNumber y) (= x (+ y 1))) (Larger x y))\n2. (implies (Larger x y) (not (Larger y x)))\n3. (RealNumber 6) (RealNumber 7) (RealNumber 8)\n4. (= 7 (+ 6 1))\n5. (= 8 (+ 7 1))\n6. (Positive 2)\n7. (implies (Positive x) (Positive (* 2 x)))\n8. (= 8 (* 4 2))\n9. (= 4 (* 2 2))\n10. (Larger 8 7)\n\nNow you can use Prover9 to check whether the conclusion follows from the premises. To do this, create a script with the premises and conclusion in Prover9 format, and run the script using the Prover9 command. For example, you can use the following Prolog code:\n\n```prolog\n:- set_prolog_flag(prolog_stack, 5000000).\n:- set_prolog_flag(oc_fail, false).\n\n:- op(900, xfx, implies).\n:- op(850, xfy, and).\n:- op(850, xfy, or).\n:- op(800, xfy, not).\n:- op(700, xfx, =).\n:- op(700, xfx, <).\n\nimplies(A, B) :- \\+ A, B.\nand(A, B) :- A, B.\nor(A, B) :- A; B.\nnot(A) :- \\+ A.\n\nRealNumber(6).\nRealNumber(7).\nRealNumber(8).\n\n(=)(7, (+ 6 1)).\n(=)(8, (+ 7 1)).\nPositive(2).\n\n(implies)((Positive(X)), (Positive(* 2 X))).\n(=)(8, (* 4 2)).\n(=)(4, (* 2 2)).\n(Larger)(8, 7).\n\n```\n\nSave the code in a file named, for example, \"prover9.pl\". Then run Prover9 with the following command:\n\n```bash\nprover9 prover9.pl\n```\n\nIf the conclusion follows from the premises, Prover9 will return the proof, otherwise it will not find any proof.", "TEXT: Six, seven and eight are real numbers.\nFOL: (RealNumber(6) & RealNumber(7) & RealNumber(8))\nTEXT: If a real number equals another real number added by one, the first number is larger.\nFOL: (RealNumber(x) & RealNumber(y) & (x = y + 1) -> (x > y))\nTEXT: If the number x is larger than the number y, then y is not larger than x.\nFOL: (x > y) -> (-(y > x))\nTEXT: Seven equals six plus one.\nFOL: (7 = 6 + 1)\nTEXT: Eight equals seven plus one.\nFOL: (8 = 7 + 1)\nTEXT: Two is positive.\nFOL: Positive(2)\nTEXT: If a number is positive, then the double of it is also positive.\nFOL: (Positive(x) -> Positive(2*x))\nTEXT: Eight is the double of four.\nFOL: (8 = 4 * 2)\nTEXT: Four is the double of two.\nFOL: (4 = 2 * 2)\nTEXT: Eight is larger than seven.\nFOL: (8 > 7)", "TEXT: Six, seven and eight are real numbers.\nFOL: RealNumber(6) & RealNumber(7) & RealNumber(8)\n\nTEXT: If a real number equals another real number added by one, the first number is larger.\nFOL: forall x y.

The theorem 'CreatesInnovativeIdeas(DouglasAdams)' can be derived as follows:\n\n1. From the first premise, we know that 'DouglasAdams' is an 'Author'.\n2. From the third premise, we know that 'Author' implies 'Writer'. So, 'DouglasAdams' is a 'Writer'.\n3. From the fourth premise, we know that 'Writer' implies 'CreatesInnovativeIdeas'. So, 'DouglasAdams' creates 'InnovativeIdeas'.\n4. From the fifth premise, we know that some books containing 'InnovativeIdeas' are about 'Technology'. Since 'DouglasAdams' created the book collection 'The Salmon of Doubt', and from the second premise we know that 'The Salmon of Doubt' is about 'Technology', it follows that 'DouglasAdams' created a book containing 'InnovativeIdeas' about 'Technology'.\n5. Thus, 'DouglasAdams' creates 'InnovativeIdeas'."], "answers": ["True", "True", "True", "True", "True", "True", "True", "True", "True", "True"], "reference": "True", "time_total": 41.41493010520935, "time_llm": 41.371267318725586, "prompt_length": 2648}
