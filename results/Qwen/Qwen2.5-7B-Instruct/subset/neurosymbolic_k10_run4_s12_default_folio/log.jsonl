However, based on the given premises, we can see that the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises. Here\u2019s why:\n\n1. **Premise Analysis**:\n   - `ChoralConductor(MiroslavVenhoda)`: Miroslav Venhoda is a choral conductor.\n   - `SpecializedIn(MiroslavVenhoda, Renaissance)`: Miroslav Venhoda specialized in the performance of Renaissance music.\n   - `SpecializedIn(MiroslavVenhoda, Baroque)`: Miroslav Venhoda also specialized in the performance of Baroque music.\n   - `all x. (ChoralConductor(x) -> Musician(x))`: Any choral conductor is a musician.\n   - `exists x. (Musician(x) & LoveMusic(x))`: Some musicians love music.\n   - `PublishedBook(MiroslavVenhoda, MethodofStudyingGregorianChant, 1946)`: Miroslav Venhoda published a book on Gregorian Chant in 1946.\n\n2. **Conclusion Analysis**:\n   - The conclusion states: `No choral conductor specialized in the performance of Renaissance.`\n\nGiven that Miroslav Venhoda is a choral conductor and he specialized in the performance of Renaissance music, the statement \"No choral conductor specialized in the performance of Renaissance\" directly contradicts the premise. Therefore, the conclusion does not follow from the premises.\n\nUsing Prover9 would confirm this logical inconsistency. The conclusion cannot be derived from the given premises because Miroslav Venhoda is explicitly stated to be a choral conductor who specialized in Renaissance music.", "TEXT: Miroslav Venhoda was a Czech choral conductor who specialized in the performance of Renaissance and Baroque music.\nFOL: ChoralConductor(MiroslavVenhoda) & SpecializedIn(MiroslavVenhoda, Renaissance) & SpecializedIn(MiroslavVenhoda, Baroque)\n\nTEXT: Any choral conductor is a musician.\nFOL: all x.

Given the premises, we know that any bear in a zoo is not wild, and there exists at least one bear that is in a zoo. Therefore, if this bear is in a zoo, it cannot be wild. However, the existence of a bear in a zoo does not preclude the possibility that a bear outside of a zoo could be wild. Thus, the conclusion that \"not all bears are wild\" is indeed supported by the premises.\n\nTo formally verify this, you would input these expressions into Prover9 and see if the conclusion can be derived from the premises. Here is how you might structure the input for Prover9:\n\n```\nformulas(inline).\n    % Premises\n    all x (InZoo(x) -> NotWild(x)).\n    exists x (Bear(x) & InZoo(x)).\n\n    % Conclusion\n    exists x (Bear(x) & Wild(x)).\n\nend_of_list.\n```\n\nRunning this through Prover9 should confirm that the conclusion logically follows from the premises."], "answers": ["True", "True", "True", "Error", "Uncertain", "Uncertain", "True", "True", "True", "Uncertain"], "reference": "True", "time_total": 49.95076584815979, "time_llm": 49.897645473480225, "prompt_length": 19056}

Let's evaluate these expressions using a theorem solver like Prover9 to determine whether the conclusion follows from the premises.\n\nGiven the premise \"No reptile has fur,\" we know that every reptile does not have fur. And since all snakes are reptiles, it logically follows that no snake can have fur. Therefore, the statement \"Some snake has fur\" cannot be true based on the given premises. \n\nTo confirm this reasoning, let's input the translated expressions into Prover9:\n\n```plaintext\n% Premises\nall x. (Reptile(x) -> -Fur(x))\nall x. (Snake(x) -> Reptile(x))\n\n% Conclusion\nexists x. (Snake(x) & Fur(x))\n```\n\nWhen we use a theorem prover like Prover9 to check the satisfiability of the conclusion under the premises, we expect it to fail, indicating that the conclusion does not follow from the premises. Let's proceed with the evaluation.\n```plaintext\n% Translate premises and conclusion into Prover9 format\nthf(premise1, axiom, ! [X] : (reptile(X) >> ~ fur(X))).\nthf(premise2, axiom, ! [X] : (snake(X) >> reptile(X))).\nthf(conclusion, conjecture, ? [X] : (snake(X) & fur(X))).\n\n% Run Prover9\nprover9_output = prover9(thf(premise1, axiom), thf(premise2, axiom), thf(conclusion, conjecture))\n```\n\nSince the exact output of Prover9 is not provided here, let's assume the result of the proof search. Typically, Prover9 would return a refutation if the conclusion is not derivable from the premises. Given our logical analysis, we expect the conclusion to be refuted, confirming that \"Some snake has fur\" does not follow from the premises.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"Some snake has fur\" does **not** follow from the given premises.", "TEXT: No reptile has fur. \nFOL: all x.

However, this does not directly provide information about `Hooray! Hooray! It's a Holi-Holiday!` being a #1 hit.\n   - From the premise `HoorayHooray` was not in German #1 singles (`-GermanNumberOne(HoorayHooray)`), we have direct evidence that it did not reach #1.\n   - The premise `A song that peaks below #1 on the German charts is also a song that is not the #1 single in Germany` (`all x. (PeaksBelow(x, GermanCharts) -> -GermanNumberOne(x))`) means that if a song peaks below #1, it cannot be the #1 single. Since `HoorayHooray` was not a #1 single, it must have peaked below #1.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion `PeaksBelow(HoorayHooray, GermanCharts)` logically follows from the given premises.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe conclusion `\"Hooray!

Translate the premises into FOL.\n2. Use a theorem prover like Prover9 to check if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nHere are the FOL expressions again for clarity:\n\n```fml\nSong(x) & Produced(x, WhiteTown) -> SongName(x, YourWoman)\nSongName(x, YourWoman) -> PeakedAtNo1(x, UK)\nSong(x) & PeakedAtNo1(x, y) -> Popular(x)\nSongName(YourWoman, YourWoman) & (PeakedAtNo1(YourWoman, Iceland) & PeakedAtNo1(YourWoman, Israel) & PeakedAtNo1(YourWoman, Spain))\n-exists x.

Given the premises, we know that \"Your Woman\" is a popular song because it peaked at No. 1 in multiple places. Therefore, the conclusion \"White Town did not produce any popular songs\" does not logically follow from the given premises.\n\nThus, the conclusion is false based on the provided premises.", "TEXT: \"Your Woman\" is a song by the British one-person band White Town.\nFOL: Produced(WhiteTown, YourWoman)\n\nTEXT: \"Your Woman\" song peaked at No. 1 on the UK Singles Chart.\nFOL: PeakedAtNo1(YourWoman, UKSinglesChart)\n\nTEXT: If a song peaked at No.1 at a particular place, it was extremely popular.\nFOL: all x. all y.

Therefore, the conclusion \"The end of a relationship is invigorating\" contradicts the information provided.\n\nTo evaluate this using a theorem solver like Prover9, you would input the premises and the negation of the conclusion to check if it results in a contradiction, indicating that the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.\n\nHere is how you can format the input for Prover9:\n\n```plaintext\n% Premises\nall x.

Therefore, the conclusion does not follow from the premises.\n\nTo confirm this, you can input these expressions into a theorem prover like Prover9.

Given the premises, we know that since 'Bulbophyllum attenuatum' is in the genus Bulbophyllum, it must be an orchid according to the second premise.

However, based on the premises provided, we can already see that the conclusion does not logically follow. Here's why:\n\n1. The first premise states that the SAT test is wholly owned and developed by the College Board.\n2. The conclusion asserts that the SAT test is owned by both the College Board and other third parties.\n\nThese two statements are contradictory. Therefore, the conclusion does not follow from the premises. We can confirm this by attempting to prove the conclusion using Prover9, but the result will likely show that the conclusion cannot be derived from the given premises.\n\nLet's structure the input for Prover9:\n\n```"], "answers": ["Uncertain", "Uncertain", "True", "Uncertain", "True", "Uncertain", "True", "Uncertain", "True", "Uncertain"], "reference": "False", "time_total": 86.52107453346252, "time_llm": 86.46730637550354, "prompt_length": 20097}

We need to determine if the conclusion \"TeslaModel3(johnsCar)\" follows from the premises.\n\nHere\u2019s how we can translate and evaluate the given premises and conclusion:\n\n1. **Premise 1**: If something can transport multiple passengers, then they are not one-seaters.\n   \\[\n   \\text{all } x. (\\text{CanTransportMultiplePassengers}(x) \\rightarrow \\neg \\text{OneSeater}(x))\n   \\]\n\n2. **Premise 2**: All Tesla Model 3 can transport multiple passengers.\n   \\[\n   \\text{all } x. (\\text{TeslaModel3}(x) \\rightarrow \\text{CanTransportMultiplePassengers}(x))\n   \\]\n\n3. **Premise 3**: All single-seat electric cars are one-seaters.\n   \\[\n   \\text{all } x. (\\text{SingleSeatElectricCar}(x) \\rightarrow \\text{OneSeater}(x))\n   \\]\n\n4. **Premise 4**: All Solo EV cars are single-seat electric cars.\n   \\[\n   \\text{all } x. (\\text{SoloEVCar}(x) \\rightarrow \\text{SingleSeatElectricCar}(x))\n   \\]\n\n5. **Premise 5**: If John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, then John's car is not a Tesla Model 3 or a single-seat electric car.\n   \\[\n   \\neg \\text{TeslaModel3}(\\text{johnsCar}) \\rightarrow \\neg \\text{TeslaModel3}(\\text{johnsCar}) \\vee \\neg \\text{SingleSeatElectricCar}(\\text{johnsCar})\n   \\]\n\n6. **Conclusion**: John's car is a Tesla Model 3.\n   \\[\n   \\text{TeslaModel3}(\\text{johnsCar})\n   \\]\n\nTo check if the conclusion follows from the premises, we need to see if the premises logically imply the conclusion. Let's break down the logical steps:\n\n- From Premise 2, if John's car is a Tesla Model 3, then it can transport multiple passengers.\n- From Premise 1, if John's car can transport multiple passengers, then it cannot be a one-seater.\n- From Premise 3, if John's car is a single-seat electric car, then it is a one-seater.\n- Therefore, if John's car is a single-seat electric car, it cannot transport multiple passengers, which contradicts Premise 2.\n- From Premise 5, if John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, then it must either not be a Tesla Model 3 or not be a single-seat electric car.\n- Given that if it is not a Tesla Model 3, it must be a single-seat electric car (contradicting Premise 2), the only consistent scenario is that John's car is a Tesla Model 3.\n\nThus, the conclusion \"TeslaModel3(johnsCar)\" logically follows from the premises.\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{TeslaModel3(johnsCar)}}\n\\]", "TEXT: If something can transport multiple passengers, then they are not one-seaters.\nFOL: all x.

Given the structure of the premises, it's clear that if John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, it must be a single-seat electric car (or a Solo EV car, which is a subset of single-seat electric cars). However, the premise that if John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, it is not a Tesla Model 3 or a single-seat electric car directly contradicts the possibility that John's car could be anything else, leading to a contradiction unless John's car is indeed a Tesla Model 3.\n\nThus, the conclusion that \"John's car is a Tesla Model 3\" logically follows from the given premises. Prover9 would confirm this logical consistency if correctly configured and run.", "TEXT: If something can transport multiple passengers, then they are not one-seaters.\nFOL: all x.
