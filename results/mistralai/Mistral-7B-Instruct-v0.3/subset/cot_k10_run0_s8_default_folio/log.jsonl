Since the first premise tells us that if something can transport multiple passengers, then they are not one-seaters, and we don't know whether John's car is a one-seater, we cannot determine whether John's car is a Tesla Model 3. Therefore, it is uncertain whether John's car is a Tesla Model 3.\nANSWER:\tUncertain\n", "\nLet's think step by step. We want to evaluate if John's car is a Tesla Model 3. We know that if something can transport multiple passengers, it is not a one-seater. We also know that all Tesla Model 3 can transport multiple passengers. Therefore, if John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, it must be a one-seater. Since we don't have any information about whether John's car is a one-seater, we cannot determine if John's car is a Tesla Model 3. Therefore, it is uncertain whether John's car is a Tesla Model 3.\nANSWER:\tUncertain\n", "\nLet's think step by step. We want to evaluate if John's car is a Tesla Model 3. From the fifth premise, we know that if John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, then it is not a Tesla Model 3 or a single-seat electric car. Since we know that all Tesla Model 3 can transport multiple passengers, which means they are not one-seaters, and all single-seat electric cars are one-seaters, it means that if John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, it is a single-seat electric car. However, we are given no information about the car that John drives, so we cannot determine whether it is a Tesla Model 3 or not, so the statement is uncertain.\nANSWER:\tUncertain\n", "\nLet's think step by step. We want to evaluate if John's car is a Tesla Model 3. From the last premise, we know that if John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, then it is not a Tesla Model 3 or a single-seat electric car. This means that if John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, then it cannot be a Tesla Model 3. This also means that if John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, then it must be a single-seat electric car. However, we don't have any information about John's car being a single-seat electric car. Therefore, it is uncertain if John's car is a Tesla Model 3.\nANSWER:\tUncertain\n", "\nLet's think step by step. We want to evaluate if John's car is a Tesla Model 3. Since John's car is not a single-seat electric car, it is not a Solo EV car. However, we don't know if John's car is a Tesla Model 3. From the premises, we know that if John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, it is not a Tesla Model 3 or a single-seat electric car. Since we already know that John's car is not a single-seat electric car, the only way for this statement to be true is if John's car is not a Tesla Model 3. Since John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, it is false that John's car is a Tesla Model 3.\nANSWER:\tFalse\n"], "answers": ["Uncertain", "Uncertain", "Uncertain", "Uncertain", "Uncertain", "Uncertain", "Uncertain", "Uncertain", "Uncertain", "False"], "reference": "Uncertain", "time_s": 26.23550581932068}
