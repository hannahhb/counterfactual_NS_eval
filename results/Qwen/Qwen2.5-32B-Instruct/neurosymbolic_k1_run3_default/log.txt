FOL: -District(Yangshuo, Guilin)
TEXT: Xiangshan and Diecai are districts in the same city.
FOL: SameCity(District(Xiangshan, Guilin), District(Diecai, Guilin))

Note: The FOL expression for the conclusion could be simplified to just state that both Xiangshan and Diecai are districts of Guilin since we already know from the premises that they are districts within the same city, Guilin. However, if the objective is to strictly express that they are in the same city as per the conclusion:
FOL: SameCity(Xiangshan, Diecai)

This last formulation assumes `SameCity` is defined in such a way that it checks if both entities are districts of the same city, leveraging the information provided in the premises about their locations in Guilin.

There's no information given about the state of unhappiness when a person is not hungry. Therefore, the conclusion provided does not logically follow from the premises.
