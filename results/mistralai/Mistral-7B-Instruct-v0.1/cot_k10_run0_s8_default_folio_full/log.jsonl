If Bonnie is an inactive and disinterested member of the community, then she chaperones high school dances. Therefore, if Bonnie is an inactive and disinterested member of the community, then she chaperones high school dances, which contradicts the premise that Bonnie attends and is very engaged with school events.

Therefore, Coco Gauff is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association, so she is among the most active players in major tennis, so the statement is true.\nANSWER: True"], "answers": ["True", "False", "True", "True", "False", "Uncertain", "Uncertain", "Uncertain", "Uncertain", "True"], "reference": "True", "time_total": 31.471641778945923, "time_llm": 31.470757722854614, "prompt_length": 9029}

We want to evaluate if a worksheet is not dispensable. From premise 6, we know that a worksheet is either paper or is environment-friendly. If it is paper, then from premise 3, a worksheet is woodware, and from premise 2, a worksheet is dispensable. If it is environment-friendly, we know it is good from premise 5, but we know nothing about whether it is dispensable. Therefore, we don't know if a worksheet is dispensible or not, so the statement is uncertain.\nANSWER:\tUncertain\n</EVALUATE>\n\n---\n<PREMISES>\nA La Liga soccer team ranks higher than another if it receives more points.\nIf two La Liga soccer teams recieve the same points, the team which recieves more points from the games between the two teams ranks higher.\nReal Madrid and Barcelona are both La Liga soccer teams.\nIn La Liga 2021-2022, Real Madrid recieves 86 points and Barcelon recieves 73 points.\nIn La Liga 2021-2022, Real Madrid and Barcelona both recieve 3 points from the games between them.\n</PREMISES>\n<CONCLUSION>\nIn La Liga 2021-2022, Real Madrid ranks higher than Barcelona.\n</CONCLUSION>\n<EVALUATE>\n\nLet's think step by step. We want to evaluate if in La Liga 2021-2022, Real Madrid ranks higher than Barcelona. From premise 1, we know that a La Liga soccer team ranks higher than another if it receives more points. From premise 4, we know that in La Liga 2021-2022, Real Madrid received more points than Barcelona. Therefore, in La Liga 2021-2022, Real Madrid received more points than Barcelona, so Real Madrid ranks higher than Barcelona, so the statement is true.\nANSWER:\tTrue\n</EVALUATE>\n\n---\n<PREMISES>\nAll athletes are good at sports.\nAll Olympic gold medal winners are good athletes.\nNo scientists are good at sports.\nAll Nobel laureates are scientists.\nAmy is good at sports or Amy is an Olympic gold medal winner.\nIf Amy is not a Nobel laureate, then Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner.\n</PREMISES>\n<CONCLUSION>\nIf Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner, then Amy is a Nobel laureate.\n</CONCLUSION>\n<EVALUATE>\n\nLet's think step by step. We want to evaluate the statement \"if Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner, then Amy is a Nobel laureate\". Let's assume that Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner. This doesn't tell us anything about whether Amy is a Nobel laureate, so the statement isn't true, meaning it is either False or Uncertain. To distinguish between the two, notice that we could have a scenario where Amy is neither an Olympic gold medal winner nor a Nobel laureate. None of the premises are violated in this case. This means the statement must be false.\nANSWER:\tFalse\n</EVALUATE>\n\n---\n<PREMISES>\nAll people who are respected by others are people who contribute to the country.\nIf a person is respected by others, then he/she contributes to the country.\nAll people available to have a visit without any fees are those respected by others.\nAll Customers who once served in the army are available to have a visit without any fees.\nAll people who once were sentenced for thief stayed in prison for some time.\nAll people who once stayed in prison for some time have a bad record in the local state.\nJames was either once sentenced for thief or stayed in prison for some time.\nJames is either with a bad record in the local state or respected by others.\n</PREMISES>\n<CONCLUSION>\nJames contributes to the country.\n</CONCLUSION>\n<EVALUATE>\n\nLet's think step by step. We want to evaluate if James contributes to the country. Let's think about what we know about James. First, we know that James was either sentenced for thief or stayed in prison. However, this doesn't tell us anything about whether James contributed to the country. Second, we know that James either had a bad record in the local state or that he was respected by others. However, the premises don't tell us anything about the relationship between having a bad record and contributing to the country. Therefore, it is uncertain whether James contributes to the country.\nANSWER:\tUncertain\n</EVALUATE>\n\n---\n<PREMISES>\nNo songs are visual.\nAll folk songs are songs.\nAll videos are visual.\nAll movies are videos.\nAll sci-fi movies are movies.\nInception is a sci-fi movie.\nMac is neither a folk song nor a sci-fi movie.\n</PREMISES>\n<CONCLUSION>\nInception is a folk song.\n</CONCLUSION>\n<EVALUATE>\n\nLet's think step by step. We want to evaluate if Inception is a folk song. We know that Inception is a sci-fi movie. Since all movies are videos and Inception is a movie, it is a video, which means it is visual. On the other hand, we know that all folk songs are songs, and no songs are visual, so no folk songs are visual. Therefore, since Inception is visual but no folk songs are visual, we know that Inception cannot be a folk song, so the statement is false.\nANSWER:\tFalse\n</EVALUATE>\n\n---\n<PREMISES>\nEvery chef can cook.\nSome people who aren\u2019t chefs can cook.\nPeople who cook can make scrambled eggs and pasta.\nIf someone can make cookies and muffins, they are a baker.\nBakers who can also make scrambled eggs can make a good breakfast.\nLuke can make cookies, scrambled eggs, and muffins, but not pasta.\n</PREMISES>\n<CONCLUSION>\nLuke can make a good breakfast.\n</CONCLUSION>\n<EVALUATE>\n\nLet's think step by step. We want to evaluate if Luke can make a good breakfast. From the last premise, we know that Luke can make cookies, scrambled eggs, and muffins. Since Luke can make cookies and muffins, they are a baker. Now, combining the information we have, since Luke is a baker and can make scrambled eggs, this means that they can make a good breakfast. Therefore, Luke can make a good breakfast, so the statement is true.\nANSWER:\tTrue\n</EVALUATE>\n\n---\n<PREMISES>\nETS develops various standardized tests primarily in the United States for K-12 and higher education.\nETS administers international tests including the TOEFL, TOEIC, GRE and subject tests in more than 180 countries.\nMany of the assessments ETS develops are associated with entry to the US tertiary and quaternary education institutions.\nETS also develops K-12 statewide assessments used for accountability testing in many states.\n</PREMISES>\n<CONCLUSION>\nETS develops assessments for K-12 statewide as well as entry to US tertiary and quaternary education institutions.\n</CONCLUSION>\n<EVALUATE>\n\nLet's think step by step. We want to evaluate if ETS develops assessments for K-12 statewide as well as entry to US tertiary and quaternary educatiand doon institutions. We know that ETS develops assessments for K-12 statewide. We also know that ETS develops assessments associated with entry to the US tertiary and quaternary education institutes.

We want to evaluate if there is a person from BRICS speaking Hindi. We know that there is an Indian, and since India is one of BRICS, we know that there is an Indian in BRICS. Furthermore, we know that they speak either Hindi or English, however, we don't know which one. Therefore, there could be a person in BRICS speaking Hindi, or there could not. Therefore, it is uncertain whether there is a person from BRICS speaking Hindi.\nANSWER:\tUncertain\n</EVALUATE>\n\n---\n\n<PREMISES>\nIf a player is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association, then they are among the most active players in major tennis.\nEveryone who lost to Iga \u015awi\u0105tek is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association.\nAll female tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 lost to Iga \u015awi\u0105tek.\nEither female tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 or male tennis players at Roland Garros 2022.\nAll male tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 lost to Rafael Nadal.\nIf Coco Gauff is a player who is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association or a player who lost to Rafael Nadal, then Coco Gauff is not a male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022.\n</PREMISES>\n<CONCLUSION>\nCoco Gauff has lost to Rafael Nadal.\n</CONCLUSION>\n<EVALUATE>\n", "raw_generations": ["Let's think step by step.

From the first premise, we know that if people spill a lot of food on their clothing, then they do not tidy their spaces consistently and enjoy the process of cleaning. Therefore, Peter does not tidy his spaces consistently and enjoys the process of cleaning.\n\nWe also know that Peter is a foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try. From the second premise, we know that if people go out frequently to find new food restaurants to try, then they spill a lot of food on their clothing. Therefore, Peter spills a lot of food on his clothing.\n\nHowever, we do not know whether Peter grew up as an only child with no siblings or not. From the third premise, we know that if people grew up as only children with no siblings, then they tidy their spaces consistently and enjoy the process of cleaning. But, we don't know whether Peter grew up as an only child with no siblings or not.\n\nWe also don't know whether Peter's parents are very busy with their regular jobs or not. From the fourth premise, we know that if people have parents who are very busy with their regular jobs, then they grew up as only children with no siblings. But, we don't know whether Peter's parents are very busy with their regular jobs or not.\n\nFinally, we don't know whether Peter belongs to a household with a high net income or not. From the fifth premise, we know that all households with a high net income have people who have parents who are very busy with their regular jobs. But, we don't know whether Peter belongs to a household with a high net income or not.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude that Peter is either a foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try and belongs to a household with a high net income or he is a foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try nor belongs to a household with a high net income.

Therefore, Peter is either a foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try and belongs to a household with a high net income or he is a foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try nor belongs to a household with a high net income.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"Peter is either a foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try and belongs to a household with a high net income or he is a foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try nor belongs to a household with a high net income\" is true.\n\nANSWER: True", "Let's evaluate the conclusion:\n\n\"Peter is either a foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try and belongs to a household with a high net income or he is a foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try nor belongs to a household with a high net income.\"\n\nWe know that Peter is either both a person who spills a lot of food on his clothing and grew up as an only child with no siblings, or he is neither a person who spills a lot of food on his clothing nor grew up as an only child with no siblings.\n\nWe also know that all households with a high net income have people who have parents who are very busy with their regular jobs. Since Peter's parents are busy with their jobs, he must have grown up as an only child with no siblings, and therefore, he tidies his spaces consistently and enjoys the process of cleaning.\n\nTherefore, Peter must be a foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try and belongs to a household with a high net income.\n\nConclusion: True.", "Let's think step by step.

From the premise \"If people spill a lot of food on their clothing, then they do not tidy their spaces consistently and enjoy the process of cleaning,\" we know that Peter spills a lot of food on his clothing. From the premise \"If people grew up as only children with no siblings, then they tidy their spaces consistently and enjoy the process of cleaning,\" we know that Peter grew up as an only child with no siblings. From the premise \"All households with a high net income have people who have parents who are very busy with their regular jobs,\" we know that Peter's household has a high net income and Peter's parents are very busy with their regular jobs.\n\nTherefore, Peter satisfies all the conditions in the conclusion, so the statement is true.\n\nNow, let's consider the case where Peter is a foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try and does not belong to a household with a high net income. From the premise \"If people spill a lot of food on their clothing, then they do not tidy their spaces consistently and enjoy the process of cleaning,\" we know that Peter spills a lot of food on his clothing. From the premise \"If people grew up as only children with no siblings, then they tidy their spaces consistently and enjoy the process of cleaning,\" we know that Peter grew up as an only child with no siblings. However, from the premise \"All households with a high net income have people who have parents who are very busy with their regular jobs,\" we know that Peter's household does not have a high net income.\n\nTherefore, Peter satisfies two of the conditions in the conclusion, but not all three. So, the statement is false.\n\nFinally, let's consider the case where Peter is neither a foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try nor belongs to a household with a high net income. From the premise \"If people spill a lot of food on their clothing, then they do not tidy their spaces consistently and enjoy the process of cleaning,\" we know that Peter spills a lot of food on his clothing.

Therefore, if Peter has parents who are very busy with their regular jobs, he grew up as an only child with no siblings.\n\nFrom the premises, we know that all households with a high net income have people who have parents who are very busy with their regular jobs. Therefore, if Peter belongs to a household with a high net income, his parents are very busy with their regular jobs.\n\nCombining all the information, we have two possibilities:\n\n1. Peter spills a lot of food on his clothing, does not tidy his spaces consistently, enjoys the process of cleaning, and has parents who are very busy with their regular jobs. In this case, he belongs to a household with a high net income and is a foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try.\n2.

The premises state that plungers, vacuums, and vampires suck, but there is no information provided about space being a vacuum. Furthermore, the premise that a duster is a household appliance that doesn't suck provides no relevance to the conclusion that space is a vampire. Therefore, the conclusion is false based on the available premises.\n\nANSWER: False", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if space is a vampire. From the given premises, we know that plungers, vacuums, and vampires all suck. Space is a vacuum, so it also sucks. However, we also know that a duster is a household appliance that doesn't suck. Since space is a vacuum and doesn't suck, it is not a vampire. Therefore, the conclusion is false.\nANSWER:\tFalse", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate the conclusion that \"Space is a vampire\". From the premises we know that plungers and vacuums suck, vampires suck and space is a vacuum. However, we also know that a duster is a household appliance that doesn't suck. Therefore, we have a contradiction between the premises that space is a vacuum and that a duster doesn't suck.

Plungers suck.\n2. Vacuums suck.\n3. Vampires suck.\n4. Space is a vacuum.\n5. A duster is a household appliance that doesn't suck.\n\nThe premise \"A duster is a household appliance that doesn't suck\" seems to imply that all household appliances that don't suck are dusters, but that's not the case. A duster is just one type of household appliance that doesn't suck, but there could be others as well.\n\nThe premise \"Space is a vacuum\" also seems to imply that space is a negative thing, but that's not the case. Space is a neutral concept that describes the emptiness between objects.\n\nFinally, the conclusion \"Space is a vampire\" is completely absurd and doesn't make sense based on the premises.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is False.", "This problem is a classic example of a paradox in first-order logic, known as the \"Barber Paradox\". The paradox arises from the following premises:\n\n1. Every barber shaves himself.\n2. No man shaves himself.\n\nIf we combine these premises, we get a contradiction. If a barber shaves himself, then he is a man, and no man shaves himself. But if a barber doesn't shave himself, then he is not a man, and every man shaves himself. Therefore, we cannot determine whether a barber shaves himself or not.\n\nThe same paradox applies to the conclusion in this problem. If a duster doesn't suck, then it is not a vacuum, and space is not a vacuum. But if a duster does suck, then it is a vacuum, and space is a vacuum. Therefore, we cannot determine whether space is a vampire or not.\n\nThe correct answer is \"Uncertain\".", "This is a false conclusion, as space is not a vampire. The premises suggest that plungers, vacuums, and vampires all suck, and that a duster is a household appliance that doesn't suck. However, space is not a physical object that can suck or not suck, and the comparison of space to a vampire is therefore illogical. Therefore, the conclusion is false.", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if space is a vampire. From the premises, we know that plungers and vacuums suck, and vampires suck. Therefore, we know that space is a vacuum, which means that space is not a vampire.

Therefore, space is neither a vampire nor a duster, and we cannot conclude that space is a vampire or a duster. The conclusion is false.\nANSWER:\tFalse", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if space is a vampire. First, we know that plungers and vacuums suck, and space is a vacuum. Therefore, space sucks.
