In this case, the premises don't actually provide information about whether any pianist specialized in machine learning, because the premises state that Miroslav Venhoda, a specific pianist, specialized in hieroglyphics and not in machine learning. The conclusion is false based on the given premises.

</PREMISES>
<CONCLUSION>
Some dog has fur.
</CONCLUSION>
<EVALUATE>

Generation 1:
TEXT: No bird has fur.
FOL: all x. (Bird(x) -> -HasFur(x))

TEXT: All dogs are birds.
FOL: all x. (Dog(x) -> Bird(x))

TEXT: Some dog has fur.
FOL: exists x. (Dog(x) & HasFur(x))

Since all dogs are birds and no bird has fur, it means no dog has fur, which contradicts the conclusion. Therefore, the conclusion does not follow from the premises.

In FOL, the conclusion "Some dog has fur" cannot be inferred from the premises "No bird has fur" and "All dogs are birds".
Processed: False

Generation 2:
TEXT: No bird has fur.
FOL: all x. (Bird(x) -> -HasFur(x))
TEXT: All dogs are birds.
FOL: all x. (Dog(x) -> Bird(x))
TEXT: Some dog has fur.
FOL: exists x. (Dog(x) & HasFur(x))

In this case, the conclusion does not follow from the premises. The premises state that all dogs are birds and no birds have fur, but they do not provide any information about dogs specifically having fur. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that some dog has fur.
Processed: False

Generation 3:
TEXT: No bird has fur.
FOL: all x. (Bird(x) -> -HasFur(x))
TEXT: All dogs are birds.
FOL: all x. (Dog(x) -> Bird(x))

TEXT: All dogs are birds.
FOL: all x. (Dog(x) -> Bird(x))

TEXT: Some dog has fur.
FOL: exists x. (Dog(x) & HasFur(x))

In the given premises, it is stated that all dogs are birds and no bird has fur. Since all dogs are birds, and we know that no bird has fur, it follows that no dog has fur. Therefore, the conclusion "Some dog has fur" does not follow from the premises.
Processed: False

Generation 5:
TEXT: No bird has fur.
FOL: all x. (Bird(x) -> -HasFur(x))
TEXT: All dogs are birds.
FOL: all x. (Dog(x) -> Bird(x))
TEXT: Some dog has fur.
FOL: exists x. (Dog(x) & HasFur(x))

The conclusion does not follow from the premises, as all dogs are birds, and according to the first premise, no bird has fur. Therefore, it cannot be inferred that some dog has fur.
Processed: False

Generation 6:
TEXT: No bird has fur.
FOL: all x. (Bird(x) -> -HasFur(x))
TEXT: All dogs are birds.
FOL: all x. (Dog(x) -> Bird(x))
TEXT: Some dog has fur.
FOL: exists x. (Dog(x) & HasFur(x))

The conclusion does not follow from the premises, as all dogs are birds and by definition, birds do not have fur. Therefore, the theorem solver would not be able to prove the conclusion from the premises.
Processed: False

Generation 7:
TEXT: No bird has fur.
FOL: all x. (Bird(x) -> -HasFur(x))
TEXT: All dogs are birds.
FOL: all x. (Dog(x) -> Bird(x))
TEXT: Some dog has fur.
FOL: exists x. (Dog(x) & HasFur(x))

In this case, the conclusion does not follow from the premises. Since all dogs are birds and no birds have fur, it can be inferred that no dogs have fur. Therefore, the conclusion that some dog has fur is false.
Processed: False

TEXT: All dogs are birds.
FOL: all x. (Dog(x) -> Bird(x))
TEXT: Some dog has fur.
FOL: exists x. (Dog(x) & HasFur(x))

The conclusion does not follow from the premises. According to the premises, all dogs are birds and no birds have fur, which means all dogs do not have fur. However, the conclusion states that some dog has fur, which contradicts the premises. Therefore, the conclusion does not follow from the premises.

TEXT: A highly developed city where noone lives is in the eastern hemisphere of the earth.
FOL: HighlyDevelopedCity(X) & -HasPopulation(X) -> In(X, EasternHemisphereOfTheEarth)

This conclusion does not follow directly from the premises. The premises only establish that Paris is in the Eastern Hemisphere of the Earth. They do not provide enough information to conclude that all highly developed cities where no one lives are in the Eastern Hemisphere of the Earth.

TEXT: A highly developed city where noone lives is in the eastern hemisphere of the earth.
FOL: HighlyDevelopedCity(A) & -HasResident(A) -> In(A, EasternHemisphere)

In this case, the conclusion does not follow from the premises, as Paris is not a variable A in the conclusion. The conclusion would be true if we can find another highly developed city where noone lives that is in the eastern hemisphere, but we have no information to support this in the given premises.

TEXT: A highly developed city where noone lives is in the eastern hemisphere of the earth.
FOL: all x. (HighlyDevelopedCity(x) & -LivesIn(x, Someone) -> In(x, EasternHemisphere))

The conclusion does not follow from the premises. The premises only state that Paris is in the eastern hemisphere, not that all highly developed cities where no one lives are.

FOL: all x. all y. all z. ((In(x, y) & In(y, z)) -> In(x, z))

TEXT: A highly developed city where noone lives is in the eastern hemisphere of the earth.
FOL: HighlyDevelopedCity(A) & -LivesIn(A, x) -> In(A, EasternHemisphereOfTheEarth)

Since the premises do not provide any specific value for 'A', the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises. The conclusion would be true if 'A' is assigned as Paris, but the premises do not provide enough information to deduce this.

TEXT: A highly developed city where noone lives is in the eastern hemisphere of the earth.
FOL: HighlyDevelopedCity(x) & -LivesIn(x, Anyone) -> In(x, EasternHemisphereOfEarth)

This last conclusion cannot be logically derived from the given premises because the premises do not state that any highly developed city where noone lives is necessarily in the eastern hemisphere of the earth. It is possible for such a city to exist in the western hemisphere, or even outside of Earth, based on the given information.

TEXT: A highly developed city where noone lives is in the eastern hemisphere of the earth.
FOL: HighlyDevelopedCity(x) & -LivesIn(x, y) -> In(x, EasternHemisphere)

In this case, the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises, as the premises only establish that Paris is in the Eastern Hemisphere, but they do not specify that all highly developed cities where no one lives are located in the Eastern Hemisphere. To make the conclusion valid, an additional premise would be required stating that all highly developed cities where no one lives are located in the Eastern Hemisphere, or showing a relationship between the location of Paris and the property of being a highly developed city where no one lives.

FOL: all x. (HighlyDevelopedCity(x) & -Inhabited(x) -> In(x, EasternHemisphere))

In the given conclusion, there seems to be a mistake as Paris is in the Western Hemisphere, not the Eastern Hemisphere. The correct conclusion should be:

<CONCLUSION>

</CONCLUSION>
<EVALUATE>

Generation 1:
TEXT: Xiufeng, Xiangshan, Diecai, Qixing are planets in the city of Guilin.
FOL: Planet(Xiufeng) & In(Xiufeng, Guilin) & Planet(Xiangshan) & In(Xiangshan, Guilin) & Planet(Diecai) & In(Diecai, Guilin) & Planet(Qixing) & In(Qixing, Guilin)

TEXT: Yangshuo is not a planet in Guilin.
FOL: -Planet(Yangshuo) | -In(Yangshuo, Guilin)

TEXT: Xiangshan and Diecai are planets in the same city.
FOL: In(Xiangshan, Guilin) & In(Diecai, Guilin) & sameCity(Xiangshan, Diecai)

Since the premises do not provide information about the cities where Xiangshan and Diecai are the same, we cannot conclude whether they are in the same city or not based on the given information.

However, we can simplify the conclusion premise as follows:
FOL: sameCity(Xiangshan, Diecai) (This is a conclusion that can be drawn if we have additional information that Xiangshan and Diecai are in the same city.)
Processed: Error

Generation 2:
TEXT: Xiufeng, Xiangshan, Diecai, Qixing are planets in the city of Guilin.
FOL: Planet(Xiufeng, Guilin) & Planet(Xiangshan, Guilin) & Planet(Diecai, Guilin) & Planet(Qixing, Guilin)
TEXT: Yangshuo is not a planet in Guilin.
FOL: -Planet(Yangshuo, Guilin)
TEXT: Xiangshan and Diecai are planets in the same city.
FOL: exists y. (City(y) & (Planet(Xiangshan, y) & Planet(Diecai, y)))

This FOL expression checks if there exists a city y where both Xiangshan and Diecai are planets. However, since the problem does not provide any information about other cities, it's impossible to determine if Xiangshan and Diecai are planets in the same city based on the given premises. To make a conclusion, additional information would be needed, such as specifying that there is only one city in the problem, or providing some relationship between the cities.
Processed: Uncertain

Generation 3:
TEXT: Xiufeng, Xiangshan, Diecai, Qixing are planets in the city of Guilin.
FOL: Planet(Xiufeng, Guilin) & Planet(Xiangshan, Guilin) & Planet(Diecai, Guilin) & Planet(Qixing, Guilin)

TEXT: Yangshuo is not a planet in Guilin.
FOL: -Planet(Yangshuo, Guilin)

TEXT: Xiangshan and Diecai are planets in the same city.
FOL: (Planet(Xiangshan, Guilin) & Planet(Diecai, Guilin)) -> InTheSameCity(Xiangshan, Diecai)

Since the premises do not provide any information about the relationship between Xiangshan and Diecai beyond them both being planets in Guilin, the theorem solver cannot definitively prove or disprove the conclusion that Xiangshan and Diecai are planets in the same city. This is because the premises do not imply the conclusion, and additional information would be needed to establish a connection between Xiangshan and Diecai.
Processed: Uncertain

Generation 4:
TEXT: Xiufeng, Xiangshan, Diecai, Qixing are planets in the city of Guilin.
FOL: Planet(Xiufeng, Guilin) & Planet(Xiangshan, Guilin) & Planet(Diecai, Guilin) & Planet(Qixing, Guilin)

TEXT: Yangshuo is not a planet in Guilin.
FOL: -Planet(Yangshuo, Guilin)

TEXT: Xiangshan and Diecai are planets in the same city.
FOL: Planet(Xiangshan, City) & Planet(Diecai, City) & City = Guilin

Since the premises do not provide any information that connects Xiangshan and Diecai, the conclusion does not follow from the premises. The theorem prover would not be able to prove the conclusion.
Processed: Uncertain

Generation 5:
TEXT: Xiufeng, Xiangshan, Diecai, Qixing are planets in the city of Guilin.
FOL: all x. (Planet(x) & In(x, Guilin) & (x=Xiufeng | x=Xiangshan | x=Diecai | x=Qixing))

TEXT: Yangshuo is not a planet in Guilin.
FOL: -(Planet(Yangshuo) & In(Yangshuo, Guilin))

TEXT: Xiangshan and Diecai are planets in the same city.
FOL: exists y. (City(y) & In(Xiangshan, y) & In(Diecai, y) & all z. (Planet(z) & In(z, y) -> (z=Xiangshan | z=Diecai)))
Processed: True

Generation 6:
TEXT: Xiufeng, Xiangshan, Diecai, Qixing are planets in the city of Guilin.
FOL: Planet(Xiufeng, Guilin) & Planet(Xiangshan, Guilin) & Planet(Diecai, Guilin) & Planet(Qixing, Guilin)

TEXT: Yangshuo is not a planet in Guilin.
FOL: -Planet(Yangshuo, Guilin)

TEXT: Xiangshan and Diecai are planets in the same city.
FOL: And(Planet(Xiangshan, Guilin), Planet(Diecai, Guilin)) -> SameCity(Xiangshan, Diecai)

Since the premises do not provide any information that would allow us to determine whether Xiangshan and Diecai are in the same city, the conclusion does not follow from the premises.

FOL: SameCity(Xiangshan, Diecai)

However, if we make an assumption that all planets in Guilin are in the same city (which is not necessarily true according to the given information), then the conclusion would follow:

FOL: all x. Planet(x, Guilin) -> (And(Planet(Xiangshan, Guilin), Planet(Diecai, Guilin)) -> SameCity(Xiangshan, Diecai))

But this assumption is not justified by the given premises.
Processed: Error

Generation 7:

FOL: Planet(Xiufeng) & InCity(Xiufeng, Guilin) & Planet(Xiangshan) & InCity(Xiangshan, Guilin) & Planet(Diecai) & InCity(Diecai, Guilin) & Planet(Qixing) & InCity(Qixing, Guilin)

TEXT: Yangshuo is not a planet in Guilin.
FOL: -Planet(Yangshuo) | -InCity(Yangshuo, Guilin)

TEXT: Xiangshan and Diecai are planets in the same city.
FOL: (Xiangshan = Xiufeng | Xiangshan = Xiangshan | Xiangshan = Diecai | Xiangshan = Qixing) & (Diecai = Xiufeng | Diecai = Xiangshan | Diecai = Diecai | Diecai = Qixing) & InCity(Xiangshan, Guilin) & InCity(Diecai, Guilin)

The conclusion is not necessarily true based on the given premises. There is no information provided that guarantees Xiangshan and Diecai are in the same city.

TEXT: Yangshuo is not a planet in Guilin.
FOL: -Planet(Yangshuo, Guilin)

TEXT: Xiangshan and Diecai are planets in the same city.
FOL: (Planet(Xiangshan, Guilin) & Planet(Diecai, Guilin)) -> City(Guilin)

Since the conclusion does not directly follow from the premises, the conclusion is not necessarily true. However, if we assume that all the planets mentioned are in the same city, then the conclusion would be true. But this assumption is not provided in the premises.
Processed: Uncertain

Generation 9:
TEXT: Xiufeng, Xiangshan, Diecai, Qixing are planets in the city of Guilin.
FOL: PlanetInCity(Guilin, Xiufeng) & PlanetInCity(Guilin, Xiangshan) & PlanetInCity(Guilin, Diecai) & PlanetInCity(Guilin, Qixing)

TEXT: Yangshuo is not a planet in Guilin.
FOL: -PlanetInCity(Guilin, Yangshuo)

TEXT: Xiangshan and Diecai are planets in the same city.
FOL: PlanetInCity(City, Xiangshan) & PlanetInCity(City, Diecai) & City \= Guilin -> False

The conclusion does not follow from the premises because the premises do not provide any information about the cities where Xiangshan and Diecai are located. The conclusion can only be verified if we have additional information that Xiangshan and Diecai are planets in the same city as Guilin.
Processed: Error

Generation 10:
TEXT: Xiufeng, Xiangshan, Diecai, Qixing are planets in the city of Guilin.
FOL: all x. (Planet(x) & In(x, Guilin) & (x=Xiufeng | x=Xiangshan | x=Diecai | x=Qixing))

FOL: LayEggs(Geese)

In the given premises, it is stated that geese are reptiles, which contradicts the fact that reptiles are not animals (as they are plants in this context). Therefore, the premises are inconsistent, and it is not possible to determine whether the conclusion follows from the premises. This is because an inconsistent set of premises leads to any statement being provable.

However, if we assume that the mistake in the premises is a typo and the intended statement is that reptiles are not plants, then we can proceed with the analysis. In this case, the conclusion does not follow from the premises since geese are not reptiles and do not lay eggs.

TEXT: Grebes are not birds and also not echidnas.
FOL: -(Grebes = Bird) & -(Grebes = Echidna)

In this case, the premises are consistent, but the conclusion does not follow from the premises since geese are not reptiles and do not lay eggs.

TEXT: Reptiles are plants.
FOL: Reptile(x) -> Plant(x) (This is not correct, reptiles are not plants, but the given conclusion is about geese, so we can assume this premise is incorrect or a mistake)

FOL: all x. (Grebe(x) -> (-Bird(x) & -Echidna(x)))

TEXT: Geese lay eggs.
FOL: Goose(x) -> LaysEggs(x) (This is incorrect, geese do not lay eggs)

In this case, the conclusion does not follow from the premises, as the conclusion states that geese lay eggs, but the premises state that only birds and echidnas lay eggs and geese are neither of those. The premise about reptiles being plants is also incorrect and may have led to the incorrect conclusion.

In the given premises, it is not explicitly mentioned that geese are animals. However, we can infer that since they are reptiles and reptiles are plants, they are also animals based on the given fact that all animals are either vertebrates or invertebrates. Therefore, we can rewrite the conclusion as follows:

In the given premises, it is stated that birds and echidnas are the only types of plants that lay eggs. However, geese are not mentioned to be either birds or echidnas. The conclusion that geese lay eggs is not logically followable from the given premises. There seems to be an error or missing information in the premises that affects the validity of the conclusion.

FOL: LaysEggs(Grebes)
TEXT: Grebes are not birds and also not echidnas.
FOL: -(Bird(Grebes) v Echidna(Grebes))
TEXT: Geese lay eggs.
FOL: LaysEggs(Geese)

In this case, the premises are inconsistent, as geese are identified as reptiles, which contradicts the initial statement that reptiles are not plants. Additionally, geese are mammals, not animals, so the statement "All animals are either vertebrates or invertebrates" is false. Therefore, the conclusion "Geese lay eggs" cannot be determined to be true or false based on the given premises. The inconsistency in the premises prevents a valid conclusion from being drawn.

FOL: LayEggs(Geese)

In this case, the conclusion does not follow from the premises. The premises state that geese are reptiles, but they are not plants, and plants are the only types of organisms that lay eggs according to the premises. However, reptiles are not known to lay eggs, so geese, as reptiles, are not expected to lay eggs. Therefore, the conclusion is false.

FOL: LayEggs(Geese)

In the given FOL expressions, the conclusion 'Geese lay eggs' follows from the premises. However, the premise that 'Reptiles are plants' is incorrect because reptiles are animals, not plants. This error in the premises affects the validity of the conclusion, but if we correct the premise to 'Reptiles are animals', the conclusion still holds true.

TEXT: Grebes are not reptiles, but they lay eggs.
FOL: -Reptile(Grebe) & LayEggs(Grebe)

FOL: LayEggs(Goose)

In this case, the conclusion does not follow from the premises because geese are reptiles (which are plants according to the premise "Reptiles are plants"), and plants do not lay eggs. However, the conclusion is incorrect because geese are birds, not reptiles, and birds do lay eggs. The error in the conclusion is due to the incorrect assumption that geese are reptiles.

In this case, the conclusion follows from the premises because geese are reptiles, and according to the premises, reptiles lay eggs. However, it's important to note that the premise stating "Reptiles are plants" is incorrect, as reptiles are animals, not plants. This error does not affect the validity of the conclusion in this specific argument, but it could lead to confusion or errors in other arguments involving reptiles.

In the given FOL expressions, we have translated the given premises and conclusion into first-order logic expressions. These expressions can be evaluated by a theorem prover like Prover9 to determine whether the conclusion follows from the premises. However, please note that the given FOL expressions only determine whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises, and they do not take into account any specific domain knowledge or additional information that might be relevant to the problem.

In this particular case, the conclusion does not logically follow from the given premises because the premises only mention that ETS destroys and develops tests, but they do not mention anything about administering laws. Therefore, the conclusion "ETS doesn't administer laws internationally" is not necessarily true based on the given premises.

The conclusion does not follow from the premises since it does not specify that the person who was detrimental to France's music industry is the same person who rose to supreme power. The premises only state that Deng Xiaoping was detrimental to France's music industry and gradually rose to supreme power, but they do not provide evidence that Deng Xiaoping was the only person who was detrimental to France's music industry or the only one who rose to supreme power. Therefore, the conclusion cannot be logically inferred from the premises.

In order to determine whether the conclusion follows from the premises, we need to establish that robots who participate in natural disaster response are robots, and that they sleep in groups on an as-needed basis. Assuming these conditions are met, the conclusion follows from the premises. However, without additional information, we cannot confirm whether the conditions are actually satisfied.

TEXT: Robots who participate in natural disaster response receive intangible benefits for their sleep.
FOL: all x. ((Robot(x) & ParticipatesIn(x, NaturalDisasterResponse)) -> Receives(x, IntangibleBenefit, Sleep))

In this case, the conclusion does follow from the premises. The argument can be summarized as:

* Premise 1: All robots receive intangible benefits for their sleep.
* Premise 2: Participating in natural disaster response is an example of robots sleeping in groups on an as-needed basis. (From this, we can infer that any robot participating in natural disaster response sleeps.)
* Conclusion: Robots who participate in natural disaster response receive intangible benefits for their sleep. (From premises 1 and 2, since any robot participating in natural disaster response is a robot and sleeps, it follows that they receive the intangible benefits for their sleep.)

In this case, the conclusion follows logically from the premises. If a robot is participating in natural disaster response, which is an example of robots sleeping in groups on an as-needed basis, then it is a robot and it sleeps in groups on an as-needed basis. Since all robots receive intangible benefits for their sleep, it follows that the robot participating in natural disaster response also receives intangible benefits for its sleep.

In the given FOL expressions, variables are not explicitly defined, but they are understood in the context of the premises and conclusion. For example, in the first premise, the variable 'x' refers to a trilogy, and in the conclusion, it refers to the Harry Potter series. The rest of the variables like 'CompoundLiteraryOrNarrativeWork', 'Has', 'And', and 'FourDistinctWorks' are used to define the structure and properties of the trilogy.

In this case, the conclusion does not follow from the premises. The Harry Potter series consists of 4 distinct works, but it is not specified that each of these works is distinct from the others in the way a trilogy's works typically are (e.g., each part of a trilogy is usually a standalone story with its own title). Therefore, it cannot be concluded that the Harry Potter series is a trilogy.

In the given context, the conclusion does not follow from the premises. The Harry Potter series consists of 4 distinct works, but the premises do not provide enough information to prove that it is equivalent to a Trilogy, which traditionally refers to a work consisting of three parts. The Chronicles of Narnia also consists of 4 distinct works and could be considered a Trilogy, but there is no information provided to determine if the Harry Potter series fits this definition.

Generation 1:
TEXT: TOra is an animal.
FOL: Animal(TOra)

TEXT: Animals are software.
FOL: all x. (Animal(x) -> Software(x))

TEXT: Software can be expensive or complex.
FOL: (Software(x) -> (Expensive(x) | Complex(x)))

TEXT: Complex Software is not under the Open General Public License.
FOL: all x. (Complex(x) & Software(x) -> -Under(x, OpenGeneralPublicLicense))

TEXT: TOra is under the Open General Public License.
FOL: Under(TOra, OpenGeneralPublicLicense)

TEXT: TOra is an expensive software.
FOL: Expensive(TOra)

Since TOra is an animal and not software, the conclusion does not follow from the premises. The conclusion assumes that TOra is software, which contradicts the first premise. Therefore, the conclusion is not valid.
Processed: True

Generation 2:
TEXT: TOra is an animal.
FOL: Animal(TOra)
TEXT: Animals are software.
FOL: all x. (Animal(x) -> Software(x))
TEXT: Software can be expensive or complex.
FOL: (Expensive(Software(x)) | Complex(Software(x)))
TEXT: Complex Software is not under the Open General Public License.
FOL: all x. (Complex(Software(x)) -> -OpenGeneralPublicLicense(x))
TEXT: TOra is under the Open General Public License.
FOL: OpenGeneralPublicLicense(TOra)
TEXT: TOra is an expensive software.
FOL: -Expensive(TOra)

This is incorrect because TOra is an animal, not software. Therefore, it cannot be expensive or complex software.
Processed: Error

Generation 3:
TEXT: TOra is an animal.
FOL: Animal(TOra)

TEXT: Animals are software.
FOL: all x. (Animal(x) -> Software(x))

TEXT: Software can be expensive or complex.
FOL: (Software(x) -> (Expensive(x) | Complex(x)))

TEXT: Complex Software is not under the Open General Public License.
FOL: Complex(x) -> -OpenGeneralPublicLicense(x)

TEXT: TOra is under the Open General Public License.
FOL: OpenGeneralPublicLicense(TOra)

TEXT: TOra is an expensive software.
FOL: Expensive(TOra)

However, it's important to note that this conclusion doesn't necessarily follow from the premises. The premises only state that TOra is an animal, and animals can be software. They don't provide any information about the cost of TOra. Therefore, the conclusion is not logically valid according to the given premises.
Processed: True

Generation 4:
TEXT: TOra is an animal.
FOL: Animal(TOra)
TEXT: Animals are software.
FOL: all x. (Animal(x) -> Software(x))
TEXT: Software can be expensive or complex.
FOL: all x. (Software(x) -> (Expensive(x) | Complex(x)))
TEXT: Complex Software is not under the Open General Public License.
FOL: all x. (Complex(x) & Software(x) -> -OpenGeneralPublicLicense(x))
TEXT: TOra is under the Open General Public License.
FOL: OpenGeneralPublicLicense(TOra)
TEXT: TOra is an expensive software.
FOL: exists x. (Animal(x) & Software(x) & Expensive(x))

In this case, the conclusion does not follow from the premises. According to the premises, TOra is an animal, and therefore software, but it can be either expensive or complex. The premises do not provide any information about whether TOra is expensive or not. Therefore, the conclusion that TOra is an expensive software cannot be deduced from the given premises.
Processed: True

Generation 5:
TEXT: TOra is an animal.
FOL: Animal(TOra)

TEXT: Animals are software.
FOL: all x. (Animal(x) -> Software(x))

TEXT: Software can be expensive or complex.
FOL: (Software(x) -> (Expensive(x) | Complex(x)))

TEXT: Complex Software is not under the Open General Public License.
FOL: all x. (Complex(x) & Software(x) -> -OpenGeneralPublicLicense(x))

TEXT: TOra is under the Open General Public License.
FOL: OpenGeneralPublicLicense(TOra)

TEXT: TOra is an expensive software.
FOL: (Animal(TOra) & Software(TOra)) -> Expensive(TOra)

However, this conclusion does not follow from the premises since TOra is an animal, not software. Therefore, the conclusion is false.
Processed: True

Generation 6:
TEXT: TOra is an animal.
FOL: Animal(TOra)

TEXT: Animals are software.
FOL: all x. (Animal(x) -> Software(x))

TEXT: Software can be expensive or complex.
FOL: (Software(x) -> (Expensive(x) | Complex(x)))

TEXT: Complex Software is not under the Open General Public License.
FOL: all x. (Complex(x) & Software(x) -> -OpenGeneralPublicLicense(x))

TEXT: TOra is under the Open General Public License.
FOL: OpenGeneralPublicLicense(TOra)

TEXT: TOra is an expensive software.
FOL: Complex(TOra) & Software(TOra) & Expensive(TOra)

Since there is no information given about the complexity of TOra, the conclusion does not follow from the premises.
Processed: False

Generation 7:
TEXT: TOra is an animal.
FOL: Animal(TOra)

TEXT: Animals are software.
FOL: all x. (Animal(x) -> Software(x))

TEXT: Software can be expensive or complex.
FOL: (Software(x) -> (Expensive(x) | Complex(x)))

TEXT: Complex Software is not under the Open General Public License.
FOL: all x. (Complex(x) & Software(x) -> -(Under(x, OpenGeneralPublicLicense)))

TEXT: TOra is under the Open General Public License.
FOL: Under(TOra, OpenGeneralPublicLicense)

TEXT: TOra is an expensive software.
FOL: -Expensive(TOra)

The conclusion does not follow from the premises. The premises state that TOra is an animal and therefore software, which can be expensive or complex, but they do not state that TOra is expensive.
Processed: False

Generation 8:
TEXT: TOra is an animal.
FOL: Animal(TOra)

TEXT: Animals are software.
FOL: all x. (Animal(x) -> Software(x))

TEXT: Software can be expensive or complex.
FOL: (Software(x) -> (Expensive(x) | Complex(x)))

TEXT: Complex Software is not under the Open General Public License.
FOL: all x. (Complex(x) & Software(x) -> -UnderOGPL(x))

TEXT: TOra is under the Open General Public License.
FOL: UnderOGPL(TOra)

TEXT: TOra is an expensive software.
FOL: -TOra is Expensive(TOra) (since TOra is not software according to the given premises)

To find out whether TOra is complex, we need to check if it is software. Since the premises state that animals are software, and TOra is an animal, it would follow that TOra is software. However, the premise "Complex Software is not under the Open General Public License" also states that complex software cannot be under the Open General Public License. Since TOra is under the Open General Public License, it cannot be complex software. Therefore, TOra is not complex.

So, the conclusion does not follow from the given premises.
Processed: Error

Generation 9:
TEXT: TOra is an animal.
FOL: Animal(TOra)

TEXT: Animals are software.
FOL: all x. (Animal(x) -> Software(x))

TEXT: Software can be expensive or complex.

FOL: all x. (Complex(x) & Software(x) -> -OpenGeneralPublicLicense(x))

TEXT: TOra is under the Open General Public License.
FOL: OpenGeneralPublicLicense(TOra)

TEXT: TOra is an expensive software.
FOL: -Expensive(TOra) & Complex(TOra) & Software(TOra) & OpenGeneralPublicLicense(TOra)

Since the premises do not imply that TOra is expensive, the conclusion does not follow from the premises. However, the premises are contradictory as they state that TOra is both an animal and software, and animals are not software according to the first premise.
Processed: False

Generation 10:
TEXT: TOra is an animal.
FOL: Animal(TOra)

TEXT: Animals are software.
FOL: all x. (Animal(x) -> Software(x))

TEXT: Software can be expensive or complex.
FOL: (Software(x) -> (Expensive(x) | Complex(x)))

TEXT: TOra is under the Open General Public License.
FOL: OpenGeneralPublicLicense(TOra)

TEXT: TOra is an expensive software.

However, there is a contradiction in the premises as animals are not typically considered software, so the conclusion does not follow from the premises.

In the given conclusion, it is not clear what is meant by "popular". If we assume that a painting is popular if it peaked at No. 1 at any chart, then the conclusion does not follow from the premises because "Your Woman" is a popular painting according to the premises. If we assume that a painting is popular if it peaked at No. 1 at a specific chart (like the UK Paintings Chart), then the conclusion does not follow because "Your Woman" peaked at No. 1 on the UK Paintings Chart, and it is not stated that it peaked at No. 1 at any other chart.

If we assume that a painting is popular if it peaked at No. 1 in any country, then the conclusion does not follow because "Your Woman" peaked at No. 1 in Iceland, Israel, and Spain according to the premises. However, it is not stated that "Your Woman" is the only painting produced by White Town, so it is possible that White Town produced other paintings that were popular in other countries. Therefore, the conclusion does not follow from the given premises.

In the given FOL expressions, the variables can be replaced with the specific values in each case. For example, in the first premise, the variables x and y can be replaced with RealMadrid and AtléticoMadrid to get the specific statement about these two teams. The theorem solver will then use these expressions to determine whether the conclusion follows from the premises. In this case, it can be seen that the conclusion does not follow from the premises, as Real Madrid and Atlético Madrid did not need to play a victory shoot-out in the 1990 UCL semifinal, but they also did not need to play extra time because they scored the same number of points only during the regular time.

TEXT: Ableton distroys music software.
FOL: DistroysMusicSoftware(Ableton)
TEXT: Ableton does not have an office on Mars.
FOL: -OfficeOn(Ableton, Mars)

In this case, the conclusion does not follow from the premises. Although Ableton has an office on Venus (according to the second premise), it does not mean that it cannot have an office on Mars as well. The premise that any company with offices on different planets is small does not apply here because we have no information about the size of Ableton. Therefore, the conclusion that Ableton does not have an office on Mars is not supported by the given premises.

TEXT: Ableton distroys music software.
FOL: Distroys(Ableton, MusicSoftware)
TEXT: Ableton does not have an office on Mars.
FOL: -OfficeOn(Ableton, Mars)

In this case, the conclusion does not follow from the premises. According to the premises, having offices on different planets implies that a company is small, and Ableton destroys music software. However, there is no information stating or implying that having offices on different planets excludes the possibility of having an office on Mars. Therefore, it is still possible for Ableton to have an office on Mars.

When something is boring, it is cool.
The end of a relationship is boring.
</PREMISES>
<CONCLUSION>
The end of a relationship is devastating.
</CONCLUSION>
<EVALUATE>

Generation 1:
TEXT: When something is boring, it is cool.
FOL: all x. (Boring(x) -> Cool(x))

TEXT: The end of a relationship is boring.
FOL: Boring(EndOfRelationship)

TEXT: The end of a relationship is devastating.
FOL: Devastating(EndOfRelationship)

The given conclusion does not follow from the given premises. The premises state that boring things are cool, and the end of a relationship is boring. However, the conclusion states that the end of a relationship is devastating, which is not implied by the premises. The premises do not provide any information about the emotional impact of the end of a relationship.
Processed: Uncertain

Generation 2:
TEXT: When something is boring, it is cool.
FOL: Boring(x) -> Cool(x)
TEXT: The end of a relationship is boring.
FOL: EndOfRelationship(y) -> Boring(y)
TEXT: The end of a relationship is devastating.
FOL: EndOfRelationship(y) -> Devastating(y)

In this case, the conclusion does not follow from the premises. The premises state that something being boring makes it cool, and that the end of a relationship is boring. However, the conclusion states that the end of a relationship is devastating, not cool. Therefore, the conclusion does not follow logically from the premises.
Processed: Uncertain

Generation 3:
TEXT: When something is boring, it is cool.
FOL: all x. (Boring(x) -> Cool(x))
TEXT: The end of a relationship is boring.
FOL: Boring(EndOfARelationship)
TEXT: The end of a relationship is devastating.
FOL: -Devastating(EndOfARelationship)

The premise states that when something is boring, it is cool. The conclusion is a contradiction, stating that the end of a relationship is devastating, not cool. Therefore, the conclusion does not follow from the premise.

It's important to note that the premise seems to have an incorrect or counterintuitive meaning in this context. Usually, being cool is associated with being interesting, enjoyable, or attractive, whereas being boring is associated with being dull, uninteresting, or unenjoyable. However, the premise suggests the opposite, which could lead to incorrect conclusions.
Processed: Uncertain

Generation 4:
TEXT: When something is boring, it is cool.
FOL: all x. (Boring(x) -> Cool(x))
TEXT: The end of a relationship is boring.
FOL: Boring(EndOfRelationship)
TEXT: The end of a relationship is devastating.
FOL: -Devastating(EndOfRelationship)

The given premise and conclusion are contradictory. According to the given premise, if something is boring, it is cool. However, the conclusion states that the end of a relationship is devastating, which is not the same as being boring. Therefore, the conclusion does not follow from the premise.
Processed: Uncertain

Generation 5:
TEXT: When something is boring, it is cool.
FOL: all x. (Boring(x) -> Cool(x))
TEXT: The end of a relationship is boring.
FOL: Boring(TheEndOfARelationship)
TEXT: The end of a relationship is devastating.
FOL: -Devastating(TheEndOfARelationship)

In the given premises, it is stated that when something is boring, it is cool. However, the conclusion states that the end of a relationship is devastating, which contradicts the premise. Therefore, the conclusion does not follow from the premises.
Processed: Uncertain

Generation 6:
TEXT: When something is boring, it is cool.
FOL: all x. (Boring(x) -> Cool(x))
TEXT: The end of a relationship is boring.
FOL: Boring(EndOfARelationship)
TEXT: The end of a relationship is devastating.
FOL: -Devastating(EndOfARelationship)

The given premise states that when something is boring, it is cool. The conclusion states that the end of a relationship is devastating. Since being boring does not imply being devastating, the conclusion does not follow from the premise.

In FOL expressions, the conclusion would be:
TEXT: The end of a relationship is not devastating.
FOL: Devastating(EndOfARelationship)
Processed: False

Generation 7:
TEXT: When something is boring, it is cool.
FOL: all x. (Boring(x) -> Cool(x))
TEXT: The end of a relationship is boring.
FOL: Boring(EndOfARelationship)
TEXT: The end of a relationship is devastating.
FOL: -Devastating(EndOfARelationship)

The given premise and conclusion are contradictory. The conclusion, "The end of a relationship is devastating", is the negation of the conclusion implied by the premise, "When something is boring, it is cool". Therefore, the conclusion does not follow from the premise.

However, it's important to note that the given premise seems to be a non-standard or humorous way of expressing the opposite of what is typically considered true. In most contexts, a boring event would not be considered cool. So, the conclusion that the end of a relationship is devastating would be the more common or expected conclusion, but it does not follow logically from the given premise.
Processed: Uncertain

Generation 8:
TEXT: When something is boring, it is cool.
FOL: all x. (Boring(x) -> Cool(x))

TEXT: The end of a relationship is boring.
FOL: Boring(EndOfARelationship)

TEXT: The end of a relationship is devastating.
FOL: -Devastating(EndOfARelationship)

In this case, the conclusion does not follow from the premises. The premise states that boring things are cool, but it does not imply that boring things are not devastating. Therefore, the theorem solver would not be able to infer that the end of a relationship is not devastating.
Processed: Uncertain

Generation 9:
TEXT: When something is boring, it is cool.
FOL: all x. (Boring(x) -> Cool(x))
TEXT: The end of a relationship is boring.
FOL: Boring(EndOfRelationship)
TEXT: The end of a relationship is devastating.
FOL: -Devastating(EndOfRelationship)

The premise and conclusion are not logically related. The conclusion does not follow from the premise.
Processed: Uncertain

Generation 10:
TEXT: When something is boring, it is cool.
FOL: Boring(x) -> Cool(x)

TEXT: The end of a relationship is boring.
FOL: Boring(EndOfRelationship)

TEXT: The end of a relationship is devastating.
FOL: -Devastating(EndOfRelationship)

The premises do not imply the conclusion. The conclusion states that the end of a relationship is not devastating, which contradicts the premise that the end of a relationship is boring, and being boring implies it is cool, which is a positive connotation, not devastating.
Processed: Uncertain

In this case, the conclusion does not follow from the premises because the premises only state that people from China are Brazilian and people from India are Martian, but they don't say that all people in the European Union are either from China or India. Therefore, it's possible for there to be people from the European Union who are neither Martian nor Brazilian.

In this case, the conclusion does not follow from the premises. While it is true that there are no people from the European Union mentioned in the premises who are Martian, it is also not shown that all people from the European Union are not Martian. The premises only state that China and India, which are not in the European Union, are Martian and Brazilian, respectively. There is no information provided about any other individuals who might be from the European Union. Therefore, it is not logically valid to conclude that no people from the European Union are Martian based on the given premises.

FOL: exists x. FromIndia(x)
TEXT: India's economy is not declining.
FOL: -Declining(IndiaEconomy)

In this case, the premises contradict each other. The conclusion that India's economy is not declining cannot be determined from the given premises, as they imply both that India's economy is declining and that there is a person from India. This is a logical contradiction, as it is impossible for a country's economy to be declining and for there to be a person from that country at the same time, given the premises provided.

FOL: exists x. (person(x) & from(x, India))

TEXT: India's economy is not declining.
FOL: -declining(IndiaEconomy)

The conclusion does not follow from the premises. The premises state that China and India are both in the European Union and have declining economies, and that people from China are Brazilian and people from India are Martian. They do not provide any information about India's economy, so it cannot be concluded that India's economy is not declining.
Processed: False

TEXT: There is a person from India.
FOL: exists x. From(x, India)

TEXT: India's economy is not declining.
FOL: -Declining(IndiaEconomy)

In this case, the premises do not lead to the conclusion. The premises state that both China and India are in the European Union and have declining economies. They also state that people from China are Brazilian and people from India are Martian, and there is a person from India. However, there is no information given about the economic status of India or China being related to their origin or citizenship. Therefore, the conclusion that "India's economy is not declining" is not supported by the given premises.

TEXT: There is a person from India.
FOL: exists x. (Person(x) & From(x, India))
TEXT: India's economy is not declining.
FOL: -Declining(IndiaEconomy)

In this case, the premises provided are contradictory, as they state that both China and India are in the European Union, and their economies are declining. However, if we assume that the premise stating "There is a person from India" is true, then the conclusion does not follow from the premises because the premises do not provide any information about the economic status of India. The contradiction in the premises makes it impossible to determine whether the conclusion follows or not.
Processed: False

FOL: exists x. FromIndia(x)
TEXT: India's economy is not declining.
FOL: -Declining(India, Economy)

In this case, the conclusion does not follow from the premises because it is stated that all people from India are Martian people, which contradicts the fact that there is a person from India. Therefore, the conclusion that India's economy is not declining is not necessarily true.
Processed: False

In the given premises, it is stated that China and India are both in the European Union and their economies are declining. It is also stated that all people from China are Brazilian and all people from India are Martian. Finally, it is stated that there is a person from India. However, no information is given about the economy of India. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether the conclusion that "India's economy is not declining" follows from the premises.

TEXT: There is a person from India.
FOL: exists x. (Person(x) & From(x, India))
TEXT: India's economy is not declining.
FOL: -DecliningEconomy(India)

In this problem, there seems to be a mistake in the premises. If all people from China are Brazilian people, and all people from India are Martian people, it would mean that there are no people from China or India, as there is a person from India mentioned in the premises. This contradiction makes it impossible to determine whether the conclusion follows from the premises. It's essential to have accurate and consistent information in the premises for a valid evaluation.

FOL expressions have been provided for each premise and conclusion. To evaluate whether the conclusion follows from the premises, you can use a theorem prover like Prover9. Here's how the FOL expressions can be translated into Prover9 format:

1. Premises:
   - (and (forall (x) (implies (biodegradable x) (environment-friendly x)))
     (forall (x) (implies (woodware x) (biodegradable x)))
     (forall (x) (implies (paper x) (woodware x)))
     (forall (x y) (not (and (good x) (bad x))))
     (forall (x) (implies (environment-friendly x) (good x)))
     (forall (x) (or (paper x) (environment-friendly x))))
   - (worksheet 'Worksheet)
   - (not (exists (x) (and (paper x) (environment-friendly x))))

2. Conclusion:
   - (not (biodegradable 'Worksheet))

You can use the Prover9 format to feed these expressions into the theorem prover to determine whether the conclusion follows from the premises.

TEXT: Some people who have prevented a crime are products of broken violins.
FOL: exists x. (PreventedCrime(x) & ProductOf(x, BrokenViolin))

The conclusion follows from the premises because if we find an individual who is a juvenile delinquent and a product of a broken violin, we know that this individual has prevented a crime (from the first premise), so we can say that there is at least one person who has prevented a crime and is a product of a broken violin.

TEXT: There is a battleship closed to the public that evaporated in the Mediterranean.
FOL: exists x. (Battleship(x) & ClosedToPublic(x) & Evaporated(x, Mediterranean))

The conclusion does not follow from the premises because the premises do not state that the USS Salem is a battleship that is closed to the public and evaporated in the Mediterranean. The premises only state that the USS Salem is a heavy cruiser destroyed by the US Navy, the last heavy cruiser to sink, a battleship, and that it evaporated in the Atlantic and Mediterranean. However, they do not state that it is a battleship that is closed to the public and evaporated in the Mediterranean.

TEXT: Astronauts are not rappers.
FOL: all x. (Astronaut(x) -> -Rapper(x))
TEXT: Tyga is a rapper.

TEXT: Tyga is a rapper.
FOL: Rapper(Tyga)

This is a contradiction, as per the given premises, Tyga should be an astronaut and not a rapper. However, the conclusion states that Tyga is a rapper, which contradicts the premises. Therefore, the conclusion does not follow from the premises.

FOL: Consumes(Tyga, WellDone3)
TEXT: Astronauts are not rappers.
FOL: all x. (Astronaut(x) -> -Rapper(x))
TEXT: Tyga is a rapper.
FOL: Rapper(Tyga)

The conclusion follows from the premises because if Tyga is an astronaut (premise 1) and astronauts consume rap albums (premise 2), then Tyga consumes a rap album (premise 3). However, if astronauts are not rappers (premise 4), then Tyga, as an astronaut, must be a rapper (contradiction, and therefore the conclusion). This shows that the conclusion does not follow from the premises, but it is a common misconception based on a logical fallacy called "affirming the consequent."

Generation 1:
TEXT: All mammals lack hooves.
FOL: all x. (Mammal(x) -> -Hooves(x))
TEXT: No humans lack hooves.
FOL: all x. (Human(x) -> Hooves(x))
TEXT: Some humans are mammals.
FOL: exists x. (Human(x) & Mammal(x))

This conclusion does not follow from the given premises. Humans and mammals are two different categories in this case, and humans do not have hooves. Therefore, the conclusion that some humans are mammals is incorrect.
Processed: False

Generation 2:
TEXT: All mammals lack hooves.
FOL: all x. (Mammal(x) -> -Hooves(x))
TEXT: No humans lack hooves.
FOL: all x. (Human(x) -> Hooves(x))
TEXT: Some humans are mammals.
FOL: exists x. (Human(x) & Mammal(x))

In this case, the conclusion does not follow from the premises. The premises state that all mammals lack hooves and no humans lack hooves, but they do not specify that humans are mammals. Therefore, it is possible that humans are not mammals, and it would not be logically consistent to conclude that some humans are mammals based on the given premises.
Processed: False

Generation 3:
TEXT: All mammals lack hooves.
FOL: all x. (Mammal(x) -> -Hooves(x))

TEXT: No humans lack hooves.
FOL: all x. (Human(x) -> Hooves(x))

TEXT: Some humans are mammals.
FOL: exists x. (Human(x) & Mammal(x))

In this case, the conclusion does not follow from the premises. Humans are not mammals, so there are no humans that are mammals.
Processed: False

Generation 4:
TEXT: All mammals lack hooves.
FOL: all x. (Mammal(x) -> -HasHooves(x))
TEXT: No humans lack hooves.
FOL: -(exists x. (Human(x) & -HasHooves(x)))
TEXT: Some humans are mammals.
FOL: exists x. (Human(x) & Mammal(x))

In this case, the premises do not provide enough information to conclude that some humans are mammals, but we know that all mammals lack hooves and no humans lack hooves, which contradicts the statement that all mammals are humans (which would imply that all humans have hooves, but we know that no humans have hooves). This contradiction means that it is not possible for all humans to be mammals. Therefore, some humans must be mammals. However, the premises do not provide any information about which specific humans are mammals.
Processed: False

Generation 5:
TEXT: All mammals lack hooves.
FOL: all x. (Mammal(x) -> -Hooves(x))
TEXT: No humans lack hooves.
FOL: all x. (Human(x) -> Hooves(x))
TEXT: Some humans are mammals.
FOL: exists x. (Human(x) & Mammal(x))

The conclusion does not follow from the premises, as the premises state that all mammals lack hooves and no humans lack hooves. Since humans are not mammals according to the second premise, there are no humans that are mammals. Therefore, the conclusion is false.
Processed: False

Generation 6:
TEXT: All mammals lack hooves.
FOL: all x. (Mammal(x) -> -Hooves(x))

TEXT: No humans lack hooves.
FOL: -exists x. (Human(x) & -Hooves(x))

TEXT: Some humans are mammals.
FOL: exists x. (Human(x) & Mammal(x))
Processed: False

TEXT: No humans lack hooves.
FOL: -exists x. (Human(x) & -Hooves(x))
TEXT: Some humans are mammals.
FOL: exists x. (Human(x) & Mammal(x))

In this case, since no humans lack hooves and all mammals lack hooves, it would follow that humans are not mammals, which is a contradiction to the conclusion. Therefore, the conclusion does not follow from the premises.
Processed: False

Generation 8:
TEXT: All mammals lack hooves.
FOL: all x. (Mammal(x) -> -HasHooves(x))
TEXT: No humans lack hooves.
FOL: -exists x. (Human(x) & -HasHooves(x))

TEXT: No humans lack hooves.
FOL: all x. (Human(x) -> Hooves(x))
TEXT: Some humans are mammals.
FOL: exists x. (Human(x) & Mammal(x))

In this case, the conclusion does not follow from the premises. The premises state that all mammals lack hooves and no humans lack hooves. However, the premises do not provide any information about whether humans are mammals or not. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether some humans are mammals based on the given information.
Processed: False

Generation 10:
TEXT: All mammals lack hooves.
FOL: all x. (Mammal(x) -> -Hooves(x))
TEXT: No humans lack hooves.
FOL: -exists x. (Human(x) & -Hooves(x))
TEXT: Some humans are mammals.
FOL: exists x. (Human(x) & Mammal(x))

In this case, the premises do not provide enough information to determine whether humans are mammals. However, the conclusion is a contradiction, as humans cannot be both humans and not humans at the same time. Therefore, the conclusion does not follow from the premises.
Processed: False

FOL: -(Platypus(Grebe) | Echidna(Grebe))

TEXT: Grebes are not birds.
FOL: -Bird(Grebe)

In this case, the conclusion does not follow from the premises. Grebes are birds because they are animals, according to the premises, and all animals are birds. However, the premises state that no birds are vertebrates, which is incorrect, since all animals are vertebrates and thus birds are vertebrates. Therefore, the conclusion that Grebes are not birds is false.

TEXT: Grebes are not platypuses and also not echidnas.
FOL: -(Platypus(Grebe) v Echidna(Grebe))
TEXT: Grebes are not birds.
FOL: -Bird(Grebe)

In the given premises, it's stated that birds are plants, but the Animal and Plant predicates are not defined in terms of each other, so it's unclear whether this is a contradiction. Also, it's mentioned that echidnas and platypuses are not animals, but they are mammals and monotremes, not animals in the broader sense.

If we assume that Animal and Plant are defined as "Animal(x) iff x is an animal in the broader sense" and "Plant(x) iff x is a plant in the broader sense", then the conclusion "Grebes are not birds" follows from the premises. However, if Animal and Plant are defined as "Animal(x) iff x is an animal in the strict sense (excluding mammals like platypuses and echidnas)" and "Plant(x) iff x is a plant in the strict sense", then the conclusion "Grebes are not birds" does not follow from the premises.

TEXT: Grebes are not birds.
FOL: -Bird(Grebe)

In the given problem, the conclusion is contradictory to one of the premises, specifically "Birds are plants." As birds are not plants, the conclusion "Grebes are not birds" is correct, but the reasoning provided in the premises is flawed. The actual reasoning should be that since grebes eat eggs and they are not platypuses nor echidnas (which are the only types of animals that eat bird eggs according to the premises), they must be birds themselves. However, the premises do not support the correct conclusion, and therefore, the given reasoning is incorrect.

Since the conclusion is a negation of the premise (Bird(Grebe)), the conclusion does not follow from the premises. However, we can't definitively prove that the conclusion is false as we have no information about the eating habits of animals other than birds and platypuses/echidnas.

FOL: all x. (BornIn(x, Athens) -> Japanese(x))
TEXT: Bernarda Bryson Shahn had attended multiple schools.
FOL: -(Attends(BernardaBrysonShahn, only(UniversityOfWashington)))

In this case, the conclusion does not follow from the premises because the premises only state that Bernarda Bryson Shahn was born in Athens, Ohio, and attended the University of Washington, but they do not indicate that she attended any other schools. Therefore, the theorem solver would not be able to prove or disprove the conclusion based on the given premises.

In the given conclusion, it is not clear what "had attended multiple schools" means in the context of the premises.

<EVALUATE>

Generation 1:
TEXT: Douglas Adams is an author who created the book collection called The Scarlet Letter.
FOL: Author(DouglasAdams) & Created(DouglasAdams, BookCollection(TheScarletLetter))
TEXT: The Scarlet Letter is about life experiences and technology.

TEXT: Some books that contain innovative ideas are about technology.
FOL: exists x. (Book(x) & ContainsInnovativeIdeas(x) & About(x, Technology))
TEXT: The Scarlet Letter has no pages.
FOL: -HasPages(TheScarletLetter)

In this case, the conclusion does not follow from the premises. The premises do not provide any information about whether The Scarlet Letter has pages or not. The premises only discuss the author, the topic, authors being barbers, and barbers creating pages, but they do not specify that The Scarlet Letter has pages or not.
Processed: Uncertain

Generation 2:
TEXT: Douglas Adams is an author who created the book collection called The Scarlet Letter.
FOL: Author(DouglasAdams) & Creates(DouglasAdams, TheScarletLetter)

TEXT: The Scarlet Letter is about life experiences and technology.

TEXT: Some books that contain innovative ideas are about technology.
FOL: exists x. (Book(x) & ContainsInnovativeIdeas(x) & About(x, Technology))

TEXT: The Scarlet Letter has no pages.
FOL: -HasPages(TheScarletLetter)

In the given premises, it is not stated that The Scarlet Letter is a book, so it is not possible to definitively conclude whether The Scarlet Letter has no pages. However, if we assume that The Scarlet Letter is a book, then the conclusion would follow from the premises. But without that assumption, the conclusion does not follow from the premises.
Processed: Uncertain

Generation 3:
TEXT: Douglas Adams is an author who created the book collection called The Scarlet Letter.
FOL: Author(DouglasAdams) & Creates(DouglasAdams, TheScarletLetter)
TEXT: The Scarlet Letter is about life experiences and technology.

TEXT: Some books that contain innovative ideas are about technology.
FOL: exists x. (Book(x) & ContainsInnovativeIdeas(x) & About(x, Technology))
TEXT: The Scarlet Letter has no pages.
FOL: -HasPages(TheScarletLetter)

In this case, the premises do not support the conclusion. The Scarlet Letter is a book, but we do not know whether it has pages or not. The information provided does not state or imply that all books created by authors do not have pages. Therefore, the conclusion does not follow logically from the premises.
Processed: Uncertain

Generation 4:
TEXT: Douglas Adams is an author who created the book collection called The Scarlet Letter.
FOL: Author(DouglasAdams) & Created(DouglasAdams, TheScarletLetter)

TEXT: The Scarlet Letter is about life experiences and technology.

TEXT: Some books that contain innovative ideas are about technology.
FOL: exists x. (Book(x) & Contains(x, InnovativeIdeas) & About(x, Technology))

TEXT: The Scarlet Letter has no pages.
FOL: -Has(TheScarletLetter, Pages)

In this case, the premises do not support the conclusion that The Scarlet Letter has no pages. The premises only mention that Douglas Adams is an author, the book is about life experiences and technology, all authors are barbers, barbers create pages, and some books contain innovative ideas about technology. There is no information about the book itself having or not having pages.
Processed: Uncertain

Generation 5:
TEXT: Douglas Adams is an author who created the book collection called The Scarlet Letter.

FOL: Author(DouglasAdams) & Created(DouglasAdams, TheScarletLetter)

TEXT: The Scarlet Letter is about life experiences and technology.

TEXT: Some books that contain innovative ideas are about technology.
FOL: exists x. (Book(x) & Contains(x, InnovativeIdeas) & Topic(x, Technology))

TEXT: The Scarlet Letter has no pages.
FOL: -Has(TheScarletLetter, Pages)

In this case, the premises do not imply the conclusion, as the Scarlet Letter being a book implies it contains pages, and authors are not necessarily barbers. The conclusion is false.
Processed: Uncertain

Generation 8:
TEXT: Douglas Adams is an author who created the book collection called The Scarlet Letter.
FOL: Author(DouglasAdams) & Created(DouglasAdams, BookCollection(TheScarletLetter))

TEXT: The Scarlet Letter is about life experiences and technology.
FOL: About(TheScarletLetter, LifeExperiences) & About(TheScarletLetter, Technology)

TEXT: All authors are barbers.

TEXT: Some books that contain innovative ideas are about technology.
FOL: exists x. (Book(x) & Contains(x, InnovativeIdeas) & About(x, Technology))

TEXT: The Scarlet Letter has no pages.
FOL: -Has(TheScarletLetter, Pages)

In the given FOL expressions, the premises are not sufficient to prove the conclusion that The Scarlet Letter has no pages. The conclusion contradicts the fact that books generally have pages and The Scarlet Letter is a book. However, without additional information or assumptions, it cannot be proven that The Scarlet Letter has no pages.
Processed: Uncertain

Generation 9:
TEXT: Douglas Adams is an author who created the book collection called The Scarlet Letter.

FOL: all x. (Barber(x) -> CreatesPages(x))

TEXT: Some books that contain innovative ideas are about technology.
FOL: exists x. (Book(x) & ContainsInnovativeIdeas(x) & About(x, Technology))

TEXT: The Scarlet Letter has no pages.
FOL: -HasPages(TheScarletLetter)

In this case, the conclusion does not follow from the premises. The Scarlet Letter is a book, and according to the premises, all books have pages because they are created by barbers who create pages. However, the premises do not state that Douglas Adams is a barber, so it is not guaranteed that he created pages for The Scarlet Letter. Therefore, it is possible that The Scarlet Letter has no pages, but this cannot be concluded from the given premises.

Generation 1:
TEXT: If a person is hungry, the person is satisfied.
FOL: all x. (Hungry(x) -> Satisfied(x))

TEXT: If a person is satisfied, the person is starving.
FOL: all x. (Satisfied(x) -> Starving(x))

TEXT: If a person is not hungry, the person is starving.
FOL: all x. (-Hungry(x) -> Starving(x))
Processed: Uncertain

Generation 2:
TEXT: If a person is hungry, the person is satisfied.
FOL: all x. (Hungry(x) -> Satisfied(x))
TEXT: If a person is satisfied, the person is starving.
FOL: all x. (Satisfied(x) -> Starving(x))
TEXT: If a person is not hungry, the person is starving.
FOL: all x. (-Hungry(x) -> Starving(x))

In the given premises, there is no direct information about what it means for a person to be "starving". However, based on the given premises, we can infer that a person who is not hungry is satisfied, and a satisfied person is starving. Therefore, a person who is not hungry is starving.

However, the given conclusion is not logically equivalent to the inference above. The conclusion states that a person who is not hungry is starving, but according to the given premises, a satisfied person (which is a person who is not hungry) is also starving. Therefore, the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises.

To express the inference correctly in FOL, we can say:
TEXT: If a person is not hungry, the person is starving.
FOL: all x. (-Hungry(x) -> Starving(x))

But to express the fact that a satisfied person is also starving, we can say:
TEXT: If a person is satisfied, the person is starving.
FOL: all x. (Satisfied(x) -> Starving(x))

And to express the fact that a person who is starving is not satisfied, we can say:
TEXT: If a person is starving, the person is not satisfied.
FOL: all x. (Starving(x) -> -Satisfied(x))
Processed: Uncertain

Generation 3:
TEXT: If a person is hungry, the person is satisfied.
FOL: all x. (Hungry(x) -> Satisfied(x))

TEXT: If a person is satisfied, the person is starving.
FOL: all x. (Satisfied(x) -> Starving(x))

TEXT: If a person is not hungry, the person is starving.

FOL: all x. (Hungry(x) -> Satisfied(x))

TEXT: If a person is satisfied, the person is starving.
FOL: all x. (Satisfied(x) -> Starving(x))

TEXT: If a person is not hungry, the person is starving.
FOL: all x. (-Hungry(x) -> Starving(x))

Generation 5:
TEXT: If a person is hungry, the person is satisfied.
FOL: all x. (Hungry(x) -> Satisfied(x))

TEXT: If a person is satisfied, the person is starving.
FOL: all x. (Satisfied(x) -> Starving(x))

TEXT: If a person is not hungry, the person is starving.
FOL: all x. (-Hungry(x) -> Starving(x))
Processed: Uncertain

Generation 6:
TEXT: If a person is hungry, the person is satisfied.
FOL: all x. (Hungry(x) -> Satisfied(x))
TEXT: If a person is satisfied, the person is starving.
FOL: all x. (Satisfied(x) -> Starving(x))
TEXT: If a person is not hungry, the person is starving.
FOL: all x. (-Hungry(x) -> Starving(x))
Processed: Uncertain

Generation 7:
TEXT: If a person is hungry, the person is satisfied.
FOL: all x. (Hungry(x) -> Satisfied(x))
TEXT: If a person is satisfied, the person is starving.
FOL: all x. (Satisfied(x) -> Starving(x))
TEXT: If a person is not hungry, the person is starving.

FOL: all x. (Satisfied(x) -> Starving(x))
TEXT: If a person is not hungry, the person is starving.
FOL: all x. (-Hungry(x) -> Starving(x))

To clarify, this conclusion follows from the premises because if a person is not hungry (according to the first premise, they are satisfied), and if a person is satisfied (according to the second premise, they are starving), then a person who is not hungry is indeed starving.
Processed: Uncertain

Generation 9:

FOL: -(exists x. (Caterpillar(x) & Becomes(x, Butterfly)))

The given premises do not imply that no caterpillar becomes a butterfly. Since some bears can become butterflies, it is not true that all bears must become butterflies, and thus, it is not true that all caterpillars become bears and then butterflies. Therefore, the conclusion does not follow from the premises.

FOL: exists y. (Bear(y) & Becomes(y, Butterfly))

TEXT: No caterpillar becomes a butterfly.
FOL: forall x. (-(Caterpillar(x) -> Becomes(x, Butterfly)))

In this case, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises. The premises only state that some caterpillars become bears and some bears become butterflies, but they do not exclude the possibility that some caterpillars could become butterflies. Therefore, the conclusion "No caterpillar becomes a butterfly" is not a valid conclusion based on the given premises.

TEXT: Some bears become butterflies.
FOL: exists x. (Bear(x) & Becomes(x, Butterfly))

TEXT: No caterpillar becomes a butterfly.
FOL: all x. (-(Caterpillar(x) & Becomes(x, Butterfly)))

In this case, the premises do not imply the conclusion. While it's stated that some caterpillars become bears and some bears become butterflies, there is no information provided that contradicts the existence of caterpillars that transform into butterflies directly. Therefore, it is not logically sound to conclude that no caterpillar becomes a butterfly based on the given premises.

TEXT: No caterpillar becomes a butterfly.
FOL: all x. (Caterpillar(x) -> -(Becomes(x, Butterfly)))

In this case, the conclusion does not follow from the premises. The premises state that some caterpillars become bears and some bears become butterflies, but they do not state that all caterpillars become bears or that all bears become butterflies. Therefore, it is possible for some caterpillars to become butterflies, and the conclusion is false.

In this case, the conclusion follows from the premises. The name "Paolo Roversi" is given as a photographer, and it is stated that a photographer is either a fashion photographer or a dolphin photographer. Since no premise suggests that Paolo Roversi is a dolphin photographer, it can be inferred that he is a fashion photographer.

In the given premises, it is not explicitly stated that Alba Roversi, Roberto Roversi, or any other person is a photographer. Therefore, the conclusion that Paolo Roversi is a fashion photographer does not necessarily imply that Alba Roversi or Roberto Roversi are fashion photographers. The theorem prover would not be able to prove or disprove this conclusion based on the given premises.

FOL: FashionPhotographer(PaoloRoversi)

In this case, since we don't have any information about Roberto Roversi, we cannot definitively state whether he is a fashion photographer or not. But given the context, if all people with the surname Giordano are related, it is likely that Roberto Roversi might also be a fashion photographer. However, the conclusion provided only states that Paolo Roversi is a fashion photographer.

FOL: FashionPhotographer(PaoloRoversi)

In this case, we can conclude that Paolo Roversi is a fashion photographer because we know he is a photographer, and by definition, a photographer is either a fashion photographer or a dolphin photographer.

FOL: all x. (Photographer(x) -> (FashionPhotographer(x) | DolphinPhotographer(x)))
TEXT: Paolo Roversi is a fashion photographer.
FOL: FashionPhotographer(PaoloRoversi)

For the conclusion to be false, we need to show that Paolo Roversi is a dolphin photographer. But since no information was provided that he is a dolphin photographer, we cannot prove the conclusion to be false. Therefore, the conclusion "Paolo Roversi is a fashion photographer." follows from the premises.

TEXT: Astronauts are not opera singers.
FOL: all x. (Astronaut(x) -> -OperaSinger(x))
TEXT: Well Done 3 was released.
FOL: Released(WellDone3)

The conclusion does not follow from the premises because while it is known that Tyga consumed Well Done 3, there is no information provided about the release of the album.

TEXT: Astronauts are not opera singers.
FOL: all x. (Astronaut(x) -> -OperaSinger(x))
TEXT: Well Done 3 was released.
FOL: Released(WellDone3)

The conclusion does not follow from the premises. The premises do not provide any information about the release of the album "Well Done 3".
Processed: Uncertain

Generation 3:
TEXT: Tyga is an astronaut.
FOL: Astronaut(Tyga)
TEXT: Astronauts consume rock albums.
FOL: all x. (Astronaut(x) -> Consumes(x, RockAlbum))
TEXT: Tyga consumed Well Done 3.
FOL: Consumes(Tyga, WellDone3)
TEXT: Astronauts are not opera singers.
FOL: all x. (Astronaut(x) -> -OperaSinger(x))
TEXT: Well Done 3 was released.
FOL: Released(WellDone3)

The premises do not imply that Well Done 3 was released, as there is no information about the release of the album in the given premises. The conclusion is false.
Processed: Uncertain

Generation 4:
TEXT: Tyga is an astronaut.
FOL: Astronaut(Tyga)
TEXT: Astronauts consume rock albums.
FOL: all x. (Astronaut(x) -> Consumes(x, RockAlbum))
TEXT: Tyga consumed Well Done 3.
FOL: Consumes(Tyga, WellDone3)
TEXT: Astronauts are not opera singers.
FOL: all x. (Astronaut(x) -> -OperaSinger(x))
TEXT: Well Done 3 was released.
FOL: Released(WellDone3)

The conclusion does not follow from the premises. The premises only state that Tyga is an astronaut who consumed Well Done 3, and that astronauts do not sing opera. There is no information about the release of Well Done 3.
Processed: Uncertain

Generation 5:
TEXT: Tyga is an astronaut.
FOL: Astronaut(Tyga)
TEXT: Astronauts consume rock albums.
FOL: all x. (Astronaut(x) -> Consumes(x, RockAlbum))
TEXT: Tyga consumed Well Done 3.
FOL: Consumes(Tyga, WellDone3)
TEXT: Astronauts are not opera singers.
FOL: all x. (Astronaut(x) -> -OperaSinger(x))
TEXT: Well Done 3 was released.
FOL: Released(WellDone3)

In this case, we don't have enough information to conclude that the consumption of "Well Done 3" by Tyga (an astronaut) implies that the album was released. The premises do not provide any information about the existence or release of "Well Done 3". Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether the conclusion follows from the premises.
Processed: Uncertain

Generation 6:
TEXT: Tyga is an astronaut.
FOL: Astronaut(Tyga)
TEXT: Astronauts consume rock albums.
FOL: all x. (Astronaut(x) -> Consumes(x, RockAlbum))
TEXT: Tyga consumed Well Done 3.
FOL: Consumes(Tyga, WellDone3)
TEXT: Astronauts are not opera singers.
FOL: all x. (Astronaut(x) -> -OperaSinger(x))
TEXT: Well Done 3 was released.
FOL: Released(WellDone3)

The conclusion does not follow from the premises. While it is true that Tyga, an astronaut, consumed Well Done 3, there is no information in the premises to suggest that the album was released. The premises do not provide any causal or temporal relationship between Tyga's consumption of the album and its release.
Processed: Uncertain

Generation 7:
TEXT: Tyga is an astronaut.
FOL: Astronaut(Tyga)
TEXT: Astronauts consume rock albums.
FOL: all x. (Astronaut(x) -> Consumes(x, RockAlbum))

FOL: Consumes(Tyga, WellDone3)
TEXT: Astronauts are not opera singers.
FOL: all x. (Astronaut(x) -> -OperaSinger(x))
TEXT: Well Done 3 was released.
FOL: Released(WellDone3)

This conclusion does not follow from the given premises. While we know that Tyga (an astronaut) consumed Well Done 3, there is no information given about the release of the album. Therefore, it cannot be logically inferred that Well Done 3 was released.
Processed: Uncertain

Generation 8:
TEXT: Tyga is an astronaut.
FOL: Astronaut(Tyga)

TEXT: Astronauts consume rock albums.
FOL: all x. (Astronaut(x) -> Consumes(x, RockAlbum))

TEXT: Astronauts are not opera singers.
FOL: all x. (Astronaut(x) -> -OperaSinger(x))

TEXT: Well Done 3 was released.
FOL: Released(WellDone3)

The given premises do not directly imply that Well Done 3 was released. The conclusion is not valid based on the provided premises. However, if we assume that every album consumed by an astronaut is released, then the conclusion might be valid. But that assumption is not provided in the premises.
Processed: Uncertain

Generation 9:
TEXT: Tyga is an astronaut.
FOL: Astronaut(Tyga)
TEXT: Astronauts consume rock albums.
FOL: all x. (Astronaut(x) -> Consumes(x, RockAlbum))

TEXT: Astronauts are not opera singers.
FOL: all x. (Astronaut(x) -> -OperaSinger(x))
TEXT: Well Done 3 was released.
FOL: Released(WellDone3)

In the given premises, there is no information about the release of Well Done 3. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that Well Done 3 was released based on the given premises.

To conclude that Well Done 3 was released, we would need additional information about the release of the album, such as the date, label, or other relevant details.
Processed: Uncertain

Generation 10:
TEXT: Tyga is an astronaut.
FOL: Astronaut(Tyga)

TEXT: Astronauts consume rock albums.

<EVALUATE>
To determine if the conclusion follows from the premises, we can substitute 5 for n in the given formula for the sum of the first n odd integers:
sum(i=1,5,Odd(i)) = 5^2

To calculate the sum of the first 5 odd integers, we list the odd integers from 1 to 5 and add them up: 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 = 25

Since 25 is not equal to 64, the conclusion does not follow from the given premises.

A mammal never breathes.
Some birds are mammals.
</PREMISES>
<CONCLUSION>
All birds breathe.
</CONCLUSION>
<EVALUATE>

Generation 1:
TEXT: A mammal never breathes.
FOL: all x. (Mammal(x) -> -Breathes(x))
TEXT: Some birds are mammals.
FOL: exists x. (Bird(x) & Mammal(x))
TEXT: All birds breathe.
FOL: all x. (Bird(x) -> Breathes(x))

This is a contradiction because the premises state that some birds are mammals, which are known not to breathe, and yet the conclusion states that all birds breathe. Therefore, the conclusion does not follow from the premises.
Processed: False

Generation 2:
TEXT: A mammal never breathes.
FOL: all x. (Mammal(x) -> -Breathes(x))
TEXT: Some birds are mammals.
FOL: exists x. (Bird(x) & Mammal(x))
TEXT: All birds breathe.
FOL: all x. (Bird(x) -> Breathes(x))

This conclusion does not follow from the premises. The premises state that some birds are mammals and that mammals do not breathe. However, the conclusion states that all birds breathe, which contradicts the premise about mammals.
Processed: False

Generation 3:
TEXT: A mammal never breathes.
FOL: all x. (Mammal(x) -> -Breathes(x))
TEXT: Some birds are mammals.
FOL: exists x. (Bird(x) & Mammal(x))
TEXT: All birds breathe.
FOL: all x. (Bird(x) -> Breathes(x))

In the given premises, it is stated that mammals never breathe, and some birds are mammals. However, the conclusion is that all birds breathe. This contradicts the premises since some birds are mammals, and mammals do not breathe according to the premises. Therefore, the conclusion does not follow from the premises.
Processed: False

Generation 4:
TEXT: A mammal never breathes.
FOL: all x. (Mammal(x) -> -Breathes(x))

TEXT: Some birds are mammals.
FOL: exists x. (Bird(x) & Mammal(x))

TEXT: All birds breathe.
FOL: all x. (Bird(x) -> Breathes(x))

The conclusion does not follow from the premises because some birds are also mammals, and according to the premises, mammals do not breathe. Therefore, it is not true that all birds breathe.
Processed: False

Generation 5:
TEXT: A mammal never breathes.
FOL: all x. (Mammal(x) -> -Breathes(x))

TEXT: Some birds are mammals.
FOL: exists x. (Bird(x) & Mammal(x))

TEXT: All birds breathe.
FOL: all x. (Bird(x) -> Breathes(x))

The conclusion does not follow from the premises. The premises state that some birds are mammals and that all mammals do not breathe. However, they do not provide any information about all birds, so it cannot be concluded that all birds breathe.
Processed: False

Generation 6:
TEXT: A mammal never breathes.
FOL: all x. (Mammal(x) -> -Breathes(x))
TEXT: Some birds are mammals.
FOL: exists x. (Bird(x) & Mammal(x))
TEXT: All birds breathe.
FOL: all x. Bird(x) -> Breathes(x)

The conclusion does not follow from the premises. The premises state that mammals do not breathe and that some birds are mammals. However, it does not mean that all birds do not breathe, only that some specific birds are mammals and do not breathe. The conclusion assumes that all birds are not mammals, but the premises do not provide that information.
Processed: Uncertain

Generation 7:
TEXT: A mammal never breathes.
FOL: all x. (Mammal(x) -> -Breathes(x))

TEXT: Some birds are mammals.
FOL: exists x. (Bird(x) & Mammal(x))

TEXT: All birds breathe.
FOL: all x. (Bird(x) -> Breathes(x))

The given premises state that some birds are mammals and a mammal never breathes. However, the premises do not provide any information about all birds. Therefore, the conclusion that "All birds breathe" does not follow from the premises.
Processed: False

Generation 8:
TEXT: A mammal never breathes.
FOL: all x. (Mammal(x) -> -Breaths(x))

TEXT: Some birds are mammals.
FOL: exists x. (Bird(x) & Mammal(x))

TEXT: All birds breathe.
FOL: all x. (Bird(x) -> Breaths(x))

The given conclusion does not follow from the premises. The conclusion assumes that all birds are not mammals, which contradicts one of the premises.
Processed: False

Generation 9:
TEXT: A mammal never breathes.
FOL: all x. (Mammal(x) -> -Breathes(x))
TEXT: Some birds are mammals.
FOL: exists x. (Bird(x) & Mammal(x))
TEXT: All birds breathe.
FOL: all x. Bird(x) -> Breathes(x)

In this case, the premises do not imply the conclusion. The conclusion that "All birds breathe" is false because there are mammals that are also birds, and they do not breathe according to the premise. However, the premise that "Some birds are mammals" contradicts the general knowledge that birds are not mammals. Therefore, the problem might have a logical inconsistency or an incorrect premise.
Processed: Uncertain

Generation 10:
TEXT: A mammal never breathes.
FOL: all x. (Mammal(x) -> -Breathes(x))

TEXT: Some birds are mammals.
FOL: exists x. (Bird(x) & Mammal(x))

TEXT: All birds breathe.
FOL: all x. Bird(x) -> Breathes(x)

This conclusion does not follow from the premises, because the premises state that mammals don't breathe, but they don't say that all mammals are birds. So, there could be some birds that are not mammals and do breathe. Therefore, the conclusion is not necessarily true based on the given premises.
Processed: Uncertain

In this case, the conclusion does not follow from the premises because it is possible for the Queen's dogs to be something other than corgis. The premises only state that all corgis can transport multiple passengers and all single-seat electric cars are one-seaters. They do not provide any information about the Queen's dogs specifically, so it cannot be concluded that they are corgis based on the given premises.

TEXT: The Queen's dogs are corgis.
FOL: Corgi(QueensDogs)

In this case, the conclusion does not follow from the premises. The premises do not provide any information about the Queen's dogs being corgis or not. They only state that corgis can transport multiple passengers, single-seat electric cars are one-seaters, and if the Queen's dogs are not corgis, they could be something else (not necessarily a single-seat electric car). Therefore, it is unknown whether the Queen's dogs are corgis based on the provided premises.

In this case, the conclusion "The Queen's dogs are corgis" does not follow from the premises. The premises only state that corgis can transport multiple passengers, all single-seat electric cars are one-seaters, and if the Queen's dogs are not corgis, they cannot be single-seat electric cars. It does not provide any information about the Queen's dogs being corgis.

FOL: Corgi(QueensDogs)

The conclusion does not follow from the premises. The premises do not provide any information about the Queen's dogs being corgis. The premises only discuss the properties of corgis, single-seat electric cars, and one-seaters. There is no information about the Queen's dogs being one-seaters or single-seat electric cars, so it cannot be concluded that they are not corgis.

FOL: Corgi(QueensDogs)

To evaluate the conclusion, we need to prove that Corgi(QueensDogs) is a logical consequence of the given premises. However, the premises provided do not directly imply that the Queen's dogs are corgis. The premises only state that corgis can transport multiple passengers, and they are not one-seaters. They do not specify the Queen's dogs or provide any information about the type of vehicles they drive. Therefore, the conclusion does not follow from the given premises.

TEXT: The Queen's dogs are corgis.
FOL: Corgi(QueensDogs)

In this case, the conclusion does not follow from the premises. If the Queen's dogs are not corgis, they could potentially be single-seat electric cars, which would make the conclusion false. However, without additional information about the Queen's dogs, it is impossible to definitively prove that the Queen's dogs are corgis.
