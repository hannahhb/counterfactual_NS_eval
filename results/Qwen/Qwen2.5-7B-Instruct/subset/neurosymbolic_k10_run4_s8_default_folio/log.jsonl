From Premise 1: \\( \\forall x . (InZoo(x) \\rightarrow -Wild(x)) \\), we know that if a bear is in a zoo, it is not wild.\n2. From Premise 2: \\( \\exists x . (Bear(x) \\land InZoo(x)) \\), we know there is at least one bear that is in a zoo.\n\nCombining these two premises:\n- Since there is a bear in a zoo, and all bears in zoos are not wild, it follows that this particular bear is not wild.\n\nHowever, the conclusion states that not all bears are wild, i.e., there exists at least one bear that is wild. This conclusion does not directly follow from the premises because the premises only tell us about bears that are in zoos. The premises do not provide information about bears that are not in zoos.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we cannot conclude that \"not all bears are wild.\" We can only conclude that there exists at least one bear that is not wild, but this does not necessarily mean there exists at least one bear that is wild.\n\nThus, the conclusion does not follow from the premises."], "answers": ["True", "True", "True", "True", "True", "True", "True", "True", "True", "True"], "reference": "True", "time_total": 37.127267837524414, "time_llm": 37.096163749694824, "prompt_length": 12490}

(Snake(x) & HasFur(x))\n\nGiven the premises and the conclusion, we need to determine if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. Let's break this down step-by-step:\n\n1. **Premise 1:** `all x. (Reptile(x) -> -HasFur(x))` - No reptile has fur.\n2. **Premise 2:** `all x. (Snake(x) -> Reptile(x))` - All snakes are reptiles.\n\nFrom these two premises, we can infer that all snakes, being reptiles, do not have fur. Therefore, there cannot exist a snake that has fur.\n\n**Formal Proof:**\n\n- Assume there is a snake \\( s \\) such that \\( \\text{Snake}(s) \\).\n- From Premise 2, since \\( \\text{Snake}(s) \\), we have \\( \\text{Reptile}(s) \\).\n- From Premise 1, since \\( \\text{Reptile}(s) \\), we have \\( \\neg \\text{HasFur}(s) \\).\n\nThus, it is impossible for any snake to have fur. This means the statement \"Some snake has fur\" is false.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe conclusion \"Some snake has fur\" does not follow from the given premises. The correct logical expression for the conclusion is `exists x. (Snake(x) & HasFur(x))`, and based on the premises, this expression is false.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion does not follow from the premises.", "TEXT: No reptile has fur.\nFOL: all x.

Here's the evaluation:\n\n1. **Premise 1:** No reptile has fur.\n   - FOL: `all x. (Reptile(x) -> -HasFur(x))`\n\n2. **Premise 2:** All snakes are reptiles.\n   - FOL: `all x.

From Premise 2, we know that every snake is a reptile. Combining these two, we can conclude that no snake has fur because if a snake had fur, it would contradict the fact that it is a reptile and thus cannot have fur. Therefore, the conclusion \"Some snake has fur\" is false based on the given premises.\n\nTo verify this, you could use a theorem prover like Prover9 to check the validity of the argument. The input to Prover9 would look like this:\n\n```prolog\n% Premises\nreptile(X) :- \\+ has_fur(X).\nsnake(X) :- reptile(X).\n\n% Conclusion\nhas_fur(X) :- snake(X).\n```\n\nAnd then check if the conclusion follows from the premises using the appropriate commands in Prover9. However, based on the logical structure, we can already determine that the conclusion does not follow from the premises.", "TEXT: No reptile has fur.\nFOL: all x.

We need to check if there is a contradiction between the premises and the negation of the conclusion.\n\nFirst, let's express the negation of the conclusion:\n- The negation of \"Some snake has fur\" is \"No snake has fur\": `all x.

(Snake(x) -> -HasFur(x))`\n\nWe can combine the second and third statements:\n- Since every snake is a reptile (`Snake(x) -> Reptile(x)`), and no reptile has fur (`Reptile(x) -> -HasFur(x)`), it logically follows that no snake has fur (`Snake(x) -> -HasFur(x)`).\n\nThus, the negation of the conclusion is a logical consequence of the premises, meaning the original conclusion cannot be true given the premises.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"Some snake has fur\" does **not** follow from the premises.", "TEXT: No reptile has fur.\nFOL: all x.

However, Ambiortus is already known; it is not a \"new\" genus.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"Yevgeny Kurochkin discovered a new bird genus\" does **not** logically follow from the given premises.\n\nTo formally evaluate this using a theorem solver like Prover9, you would input the premises and the negation of the conclusion and check if a contradiction arises.

Since the problem does not provide a specific definition, we assume that a \"new bird genus\" is any genus that has not been previously discovered by Kurochkin.\n\nHowever, since Kurochkin has already discovered Ambiortus (a prehistoric bird genus), and there is no information suggesting that Ambiortus is not considered \"new,\" we might interpret the problem as asking whether Kurochkin discovered a genus that is different from Ambiortus.\n\nThus, the conclusion would be valid if Ambiortus is considered a \"new bird genus\" for the purposes of this problem. But strictly speaking, based on the given information, Kurochkin has discovered Ambiortus, not a new bird genus that is distinct from Ambiortus.\n\nTo represent this in FOL, we could define \"new bird genus\" as follows:\n- `NewBirdGenus(x)` means that `x` is a bird genus and `x` has not been discovered by Kurochkin.\n\n**Revised Conclusion:**\n5. `exists x.

(Mammal(x) & EggLayingMammal(x) -> (Platypus(x) | Echidna(x)))`\n   - This means that if a mammal lays eggs, it must be either a platypus or an echidna.\n\n2. **Premises about platypuses and echidnas:**\n   - `all x. (Platypus(x) -> -Hyrax(x))`\n   - `all x. (Echidna(x) -> -Hyrax(x))`\n   - This means that if something is a platypus or an echidna, it cannot be a hyrax.\n\n3. **Premises about mammals:**\n   - `all x. (Mammal(x) -> -Invertebrate(x))`\n   - `all x. (Animal(x) -> Vertebrate(x) | Invertebrate(x))`\n   - `all x. (Mammal(x) -> Animal(x))`\n   - These premises confirm that all mammals are vertebrates.\n\n4. **Premise about hyraxes:**\n   - `all x. (Hyrax(x) -> Mammal(x))`\n   - This confirms that all hyraxes are mammals.\n\n5. **Premise about grebes:**\n   - `all x. (Grebe(x) -> EggLayingMammal(x))`\n   - `all x. (Grebe(x) -> -Platypus(x) & -Echidna(x))`\n   - This means that grebes are egg-laying mammals and are neither platypuses nor echidnas.\n\nGiven these premises, we can infer the following:\n- Since grebes are egg-laying mammals and are neither platypuses nor echidnas, by the first premise, there is no contradiction with the fact that they could be laying eggs.\n- However, the conclusion we are trying to verify is specifically about hyraxes, and based on the premises:\n  - Hyraxes are mammals.\n  - Hyraxes are not platypuses.\n  - Hyraxes are not echidnas.\n  - Therefore, according to the first premise, hyraxes cannot be egg-laying mammals since the only egg-laying mammals are platypuses or echidnas.\n\nThus, the conclusion \"Hyraxes lay eggs\" does not logically follow from the given premises.\n\nTherefore, the final FOL translation and evaluation confirms that the conclusion \"Hyraxes lay eggs\" does not follow from the premises.", "TEXT: The only types of mammals that lay eggs are either platypuses or echidnas.\nFOL: all x.

(EggLayingMammal(x) -> (Platypus(x) | Echidna(x)))` says that if something is an egg-laying mammal, it must be either a platypus or an echidna.\n   \n2. **Premises about Hyraxes**:\n   - `all x. (Platypus(x) -> -Hyrax(x))` says that platypuses cannot be hyraxes.\n   - `all x. (Echidna(x) -> -Hyrax(x))` says that echidnas cannot be hyraxes.\n   - `all x. (Hyrax(x) -> Mammal(x))` says that hyraxes are mammals.\n   - `all x. (Mammal(x) -> -Invertebrate(x))` says that no mammals are invertebrates.\n   - `all x.

(Grebe(x) -> EggLayingMammal(x))` and `all x. (Grebe(x) -> -Platypus(x) & -Echidna(x))` say that grebes are egg-laying mammals but not platypuses or echidnas.\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - We need to show that `all x. (Hyrax(x) -> EggLayingMammal(x))` follows from these premises.\n\nBy the premises:\n- Hyraxes are mammals (`Hyrax(x) -> Mammal(x)`).\n- Mammals are not invertebrates (`Mammal(x) -> -Invertebrate(x)`).\n- All animals are either vertebrates or invertebrates (`Animal(x) -> Vertebrate(x) | Invertebrate(x)`).\n\nSince hyraxes are mammals, and mammals are not invertebrates, hyraxes are vertebrates (`Hyrax(x) -> Vertebrate(x)`).\n\nNow, consider the premise that the only egg-laying mammals are platypuses or echidnas:\n- Since platypuses and echidnas do not include hyraxes (`Platypus(x) -> -Hyrax(x)` and `Echidna(x) -> -Hyrax(x)`), there is no contradiction in hyraxes laying eggs based on the given information.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion `all x. (Hyrax(x) -> EggLayingMammal(x))` does not necessarily follow from the given premises because the premises do not provide any direct evidence that hyraxes are egg-laying mammals. The only information we have is that platypuses and echidnas are the only egg-laying mammals, and hyraxes are not platypuses or echidnas.\n\nThus, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises provided.", "TEXT: The only types of mammals that lay eggs are either platypuses or echidnas.\nFOL: all x.

If Prover9 can prove the conclusion from the premises, it means the conclusion logically follows; otherwise, it does not.\n\nGiven the logical structure, it is clear that the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises because the second premise states that there are some artificial satellites that are not U.S. inventions, while the conclusion claims that all important scientific achievements must be U.S. inventions.

From the first premise, we know there exists at least one cat that is not a pet:\n   \\[ \\exists x. (Cat(x) \\land -Pet(x)) \\]\n\n2. From the second premise, we know all cats are mammals:\n   \\[ \\forall x. (Cat(x) \\rightarrow Mammal(x)) \\]\n   This means for every \\(x\\), if \\(x\\) is a cat, then \\(x\\) is a mammal.\n\n3. Combining these two premises, let's assume there exists a cat \\(c\\) such that \\(Cat(c) \\land -Pet(c)\\). Since all cats are mammals, it follows that:\n   \\[ Cat(c) \\rightarrow Mammal(c) \\]\n   Therefore, if \\(Cat(c)\\) is true, then \\(Mammal(c)\\) must also be true. Hence, \\(c\\) is a mammal and \\(c\\) is not a pet:\n   \\[ Mammal(c) \\land -Pet(c) \\]\n\n4. Since \\(c\\) satisfies both conditions, we have shown that there exists at least one mammal that is not a pet:\n   \\[ \\exists x. (Mammal(x) \\land -Pet(x)) \\]\n\nThus, the conclusion \"Some mammals are not pets\" follows logically from the premises.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe conclusion \"Some mammals are not pets\" does follow from the premises.", "TEXT: Some cats are not pets.\nFOL: exists x.

Here\u2019s the reasoning:\n\n1. The definition of Heptalogy is provided as `all x. (Heptalogy(x) -> ConsistsOfSevenDistinctWorks(x))`. This means every Heptalogy must consist of seven distinct works.\n\n2. The Harry Potter series and The Chronicles of Narnia both consist of seven distinct works, as stated in `ConsistsOfSevenDistinctWorks(HarryPotterSeries)` and `ConsistsOfSevenDistinctWorks(ChroniclesOfNarnia)` respectively.\n\n3. Since The Chronicles of Narnia consists of seven distinct works, according to the definition, it could potentially be a Heptalogy.

(CivilParish(x) & LocationIn(x, England)))` can be derived from the given premises using a theorem prover like Prover9.\n\nLet's break down the premises step-by-step:\n\n1. **CivilParish(AinderbyQuernhow) & LocationIn(AinderbyQuernhow, HambletonDistrict)**\n   - This tells us that Ainderby Quernhow is a civil parish in the Hambleton District.\n\n2. **LocationIn(HambletonDistrict, NorthYorkshire)**\n   - This tells us that the Hambleton District is located in North Yorkshire.\n\n3. **LocationIn(NorthYorkshire, England)**\n   - This tells us that North Yorkshire is located in England.\n\n4. **all x. all y. all z. (LocationIn(x, y) & LocationIn(y, z) -> LocationIn(x, z))**\n   - This is a transitive property of location. If Ainderby Quernhow is in the Hambleton District, and the Hambleton District is in North Yorkshire, and North Yorkshire is in England, then Ainderby Quernhow must be in England.\n\nUsing the transitive property, we can infer:\n- `LocationIn(AinderbyQuernhow, England)`\n\nSince Ainderby Quernhow is a civil parish and is located in England, we have a contradiction with the conclusion that there is no civil parish in England.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"There is no civil parish in England\" does **not** follow from the premises. The correct expression in FOL is:\n```", "TEXT: Ainderby Quernhow is a village and civil parish in the Hambleton District.\nFOL: CivilParish(AinderbyQuernhow) & LocationIn(AinderbyQuernhow, HambletonDistrict)\n\nTEXT: Hambleton District is in North Yorkshire.\nFOL: LocationIn(HambletonDistrict, NorthYorkshire)\n\nTEXT: North Yorkshire is in England.\nFOL: LocationIn(NorthYorkshire, England)\n\nTEXT: If place A is located in place B and place B is located in place C, then place A is located in place C.\nFOL: all x. all y. all z.

Therefore, **CivilParish(AinderbyQuernhow) & LocationIn(AinderbyQuernhow, England)**, which contradicts the conclusion that \"There is no civil parish in England.\"\n\nThus, the conclusion does not follow from the premises.

The goal is to see if we can derive the conclusion from the premises.\n\nFirst, let's summarize the premises:\n\n1. `CivilParish(AinderbyQuernhow) & LocationIn(AinderbyQuernhow, HambletonDistrict)`\n2. `LocationIn(HambletonDistrict, NorthYorkshire)`\n3. `LocationIn(NorthYorkshire, England)`\n4. `all x. all y. all z.

If the negated conclusion cannot be derived, then the original conclusion must be true.\n\nUsing the transitivity of location (premise 4), we can infer:\n- `LocationIn(AinderbyQuernhow, England)` from the premises.\n\nSince `AinderbyQuernhow` is a civil parish (`CivilParish(AinderbyQuernhow)`), and it is located in England (`LocationIn(AinderbyQuernhow, England)`), this directly contradicts the negated conclusion `exists x. (CivilParish(x) & LocationIn(x, England))`.\n\nThus, the original conclusion \"There is no civil parish in England\" must be false because there exists at least one civil parish (Ainderby Quernhow) in England.\n\nTherefore, the correct conclusion is:\n- **There is a civil parish in England.**\n\nIn FOL, this can be expressed as:\nFOL: exists x.

This directly contradicts the conclusion that India's economy is not emerging.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \\( -EconomyIsEmerging(India) \\) does **not** follow from the given premises.", "TEXT: China is one of the BRICS, and its economy is emerging.\nFOL: all x.

Let's evaluate this step-by-step:\n\n1. From the premise \"India is one of the BRICS, and its economy is emerging,\" we have:\n   \\[\n   \\text{all } x. (\\text{India}(x) \\rightarrow \\text{BRICS}(x) \\& \\text{EconomyIsEmerging}(x))\n   \\]\n   Since the variable \\(x\\) here can refer to any individual, we can infer:\n   \\[\n   \\text{India}(\\text{some\\_individual}) \\rightarrow \\text{EconomyIsEmerging}(\\text{some\\_individual})\n   \\]\n\n2. From the premise \"If someone is from India, then they are in a country of BRICS,\" we have:\n   \\[\n   \\text{all } x. (\\text{From}(x, \\text{India}) \\rightarrow \\text{BRICS}(x))\n   \\]\n   This implies that any individual from India is in a country of BRICS, which we already know is India itself.\n\n3. From the premise \"There is a person from India,\" we have:\n   \\[\n   \\exists x.

However, our premises do not directly contradict this; they only state that if someone is from India, then their country (which is India) has an emerging economy. The existence of such an individual does not necessarily imply that the economy of India is emerging.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we cannot conclude that \"India's economy is not emerging.\" The premises do not provide enough information to draw this specific conclusion.\n\nThus, the conclusion does not follow from the premises.", "TEXT: China is one of the BRICS, and its economy is emerging.\nFOL: all x.

However, since I cannot directly run Prover9 here, I will outline the steps you would take to do so:\n\n### Steps to Evaluate Using Prover9\n\n1. Define the predicates and their arities in Prover9.\n2. Enter the premises as clauses.\n3. Enter the negation of the conclusion as a clause (since we want to prove the conclusion).\n4. Run the solver to see if the premises lead to a contradiction.\n\nHere is how you would write the input file for Prover9:\n\n```prolog\n% Define predicates\nhatchery(X).\nlocated_in(X, Y).\nlocated_in(Y, Z).\nopen_to_visitors(X).\nfor_profit(X).\nconservation_hatchery(X).\nmight_release_animals_into_wild(X).\n\n% Premises\nhatchery(national_lovster_hatchery).\nlocated_in(national_lovster_hatchery, padstow).\nlocated_in(padstow, england).\nopen_to_visitors(national_lovster_hatchery).\nforall(X, (hatchery(X) -> (for_profit(X) | conservation_hatchery(X))).\nforall(X, (conservation_hatchery(X) -> might_release_animals_into_wild(X)).\nnot for_profit(national_lovster_hatchery).\n\n% Negation of the conclusion (to prove the conclusion)\nnot conservation_hatchery(national_lovster_hatchery).\n\n% Run the solver\n```\n\nBy running this input through Prover9, you can determine if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. If Prover9 finds a proof, it confirms that the conclusion is valid. If it fails to find a proof, it may indicate a need to re-evaluate the premises or the logical structure.\n\nGiven the provided premises and the logical structure, the conclusion `ConservationHatchery(NationalLobsterHatchery)` should indeed follow from the premises.", "TEXT: The National Lobster Hatchery is a hatchery located in Padstow, England.\nFOL: Hatchery(NationalLobsterHatchery) & LocatedIn(NationalLobsterHatchery, Padstow) & England(Padstow)\n\nTEXT: The National Lobster Hatchery is open to visitors.\nFOL: OpenToVisitors(NationalLobsterHatchery)\n\nTEXT: A hatchery is either for profit or for conservation.\nFOL: all x.

Thus, based on the premises, the book \"The Salmon of Doubt\" would logically contain innovative ideas.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"The Salmon of Doubt has no innovative Ideas\" is incorrect according to the given premises. The correct conclusion would be that The Salmon of Doubt contains innovative ideas.\n\nThus, the conclusion does not follow from the premises.", "TEXT: Douglas Adams is an author who created the book collection called The Salmon of Doubt.\nFOL: Create(DouglasAdams, TheSalmonofDoubt) & Author(DouglasAdams)\n\nTEXT: The Salmon of Doubt is about life experiences and technology.\nFOL: Contains(TheSalmonofDoubt, LifeExperiences) & Contains(TheSalmonofDoubt, Technology)\n\nTEXT: All authors are writers.\nFOL: all x.

From the premise \"All authors are writers,\" we know that since Douglas Adams is an author, he is also a writer: `Writer(DouglasAdams)`.\n\n2. Since writers create innovative ideas (`all x. (Writer(x) -> InnovativeIdeas(x))`), Douglas Adams creates innovative ideas: `InnovativeIdeas(TheSalmonofDoubt)`.\n\n3. The premise states that \"The Salmon of Doubt is about life experiences and technology\" (`Contains(TheSalmonofDoubt, LifeExperiences) & Contains(TheSalmonofDoubt, Technology)`).\n\n4. Additionally, there are some books that contain both innovative ideas and are about technology (`exists x. (Contains(x, Technology) & Contains(x, InnovativeIdeas))`). Given this, and the fact that `The Salmon of Doubt` is about technology, it follows that `The Salmon of Doubt` could contain innovative ideas.\n\n5. Therefore, based on the premises provided, it cannot be concluded that `The Salmon of Doubt has no innovative ideas`. The conclusion contradicts the logical inferences derived from the premises.\n\nHence, the conclusion \"The Salmon of Doubt has no innovative ideas\" does not logically follow from the given premises.", "TEXT: Douglas Adams is an author who created the book collection called The Salmon of Doubt.\nFOL: Author(DouglasAdams) & Create(DouglasAdams, TheSalmonofDoubt)\n\nTEXT: The Salmon of Doubt is about life experiences and technology.\nFOL: BookCollection(TheSalmonofDoubt) & Contains(TheSalmonofDoubt, LifeExperiences) & Contains(TheSalmonofDoubt, Technology)\n\nTEXT: All authors are writers.\nFOL: all x.

This indicates that the conclusion \"The Salmon of Doubt has no innovative Ideas\" does not logically follow from the given premises.\n\nTo confirm this result, let's run the Prover9 command:\n\n```plaintext\nthf(1,axiom,Author_DouglasAdams,author('DouglasAdams')).\nthf(2,axiom,Create_DouglasAdams_Salmon,create('DouglasAdams','TheSalmonOfDoubt')).\nthf(3,axiom,BookCollection_Salmon,book_collection('TheSalmonOfDoubt')).\nthf(4,axiom,Contains_Salmon_Life,contains('TheSalmonOfDoubt','LifeExperiences')).\nthf(5,axiom,Contains_Salmon_Technology,contains('TheSalmonOfDoubt','Technology')).\nthf(6,axiom,Author_Writer,all x.(author(x) => writer(x))).\nthf(7,axiom,Writer_InnovativeIdeas,all x.(writer(x) => innovative_ideas(x))).\nthf(8,axiom,Technology_InnovativeIdeas,exists x.(contains(x,'Technology') & contains(x,'InnovativeIdeas')).\nthf(9,negated_conclusion,No_InnovativeIdeas,-contains('TheSalmonOfDoubt','InnovativeIdeas')).\n```\n\nRunning this through Prover9 will show that the conclusion cannot be derived from the premises, confirming that \"The Salmon of Doubt has no innovative Ideas\" does not logically follow from the given information.", "TEXT: Douglas Adams is an author who created the book collection called The Salmon of Doubt.\nFOL: Author(DouglasAdams) & Create(DouglasAdams, TheSalmonOfDoubt)\n\nTEXT: The Salmon of Doubt is about life experiences and technology.\nFOL: BookCollection(TheSalmonOfDoubt) & Contains(TheSalmonOfDoubt, LifeExperiences) & Contains(TheSalmonOfDoubt, Technology)\n\nTEXT: All authors are writers.\nFOL: all x.

However, based on the logical structure:\n\n1. **Premise 1**: `Author(DouglasAdams) & Create(DouglasAdams, TheSalmonofDoubt)`\n2. **Premise 2**: `BookCollection(TheSalmonofDoubt) & Contains(TheSalmonofDoubt, LifeExperiences) & Contains(TheSalmonofDoubt, Technology)`\n3. **Premise 3**: `all x.

(Contains(x, Technology) & Contains(x, InnovativeIdeas))`\n\nWe know from Premises 1 and 3 that since Douglas Adams is an author, he must be a writer. And from Premise 4, all writers create innovative ideas. Therefore, since Douglas Adams is a writer, The Salmon of Doubt must contain innovative ideas because it contains technology (Premise 2).\n\nPremise 5 confirms that there exist some books that contain both innovative ideas and technology.\n\nGiven this, the conclusion \"The Salmon of Doubt has no innovative Ideas\" contradicts the premises. Therefore, the conclusion does not follow from the premises.\n\nSo the evaluation would show that the conclusion is not valid based on the given premises.", "TEXT: Douglas Adams is an author who created the book collection called The Salmon of Doubt.\nFOL: Create(DouglasAdams, TheSalmonOfDoubt)\n\nTEXT: The Salmon of Doubt is about life experiences and technology.\nFOL: Contains(TheSalmonOfDoubt, LifeExperiences) & Contains(TheSalmonOfDoubt, Technology)\n\nTEXT: All authors are writers.\nFOL: all x.

However, the premise states that \"The Mona Lisa\" is both a world's best-known artwork and a portrait.

However, based on the given premises, we can only say that Paolo is a photographer and must be either an amateur or a professional. The conclusion that \"Paolo is an amateur photographer\" cannot be conclusively derived from the provided premises alone.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"Paolo is an amateur photographer\" does not follow from the premises.\n\nTo represent this formally:\n\n```", "TEXT: Roversi is an Italian surname.\nFOL: all x.

This means that if John's car is a Tesla Model 3, it cannot be a one-seater.\n\nGiven the premise \"All single-seat electric cars are one-seaters,\" and the premise \"All Solo EV cars are single-seat electric cars,\" we know that if John's car is a single-seat electric car, it must be a one-seater.\n\nThe premise \"If John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, then John's car is not a Tesla Model 3 or a single-seat electric car\" implies that if John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, it must be a single-seat electric car (or both, which is redundant). But this is a contradiction because we already established that no Tesla Model 3 can be a one-seater (and thus a single-seat electric car).\n\nTherefore, the only consistent scenario is that John's car must be a Tesla Model 3, since being a single-seat electric car (one-seater) would lead to a contradiction. Thus, the conclusion `TeslaModel3(JohnsCar)` does indeed follow from the premises.\n\nIn summary, the conclusion \"John's car is a Tesla Model 3\" logically follows from the given premises.", "TEXT: If something can transport multiple passengers, then they are not one-seaters.\nFOL: all x.
