Bonnie is both a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities and chaperones high school dances. In this case, according to the premises, Bonnie is a student who attends the school, since she wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities. The premises also state that if someone chaperones high school dances, they are not students who attend the school, which contradicts the fact that Bonnie is a student who attends the school.

From the premises, we know that if people chaperone high school dances, then they are not students who attend the school. However, since Bonnie is a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities, she is a student who attends the school according to the premises. This violates the condition that she cannot be a student who attends the school if she chaperones high school dances. Therefore, this scenario is not possible.\n\nScenario 2: Bonnie is neither a young child nor teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities. From the premises, we know that all people who are inactive and disinterested members of their community chaperone high school dances. Therefore, if Bonnie chaperones high school dances, she must be an inactive and disinterested member of the community. However, since Bonnie is neither a young child nor teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities, we don't know whether she is a student who attends the school or not. This means that we cannot conclude definitively that Bonnie is either a student who attends the school or is an inactive and disinterested member of the community in this scenario.\n\nSince one of the two scenarios described in the conclusion is not possible, and we cannot definitively conclude the other scenario based on the given premises, the conclusion is uncertain.\n\nANSWER: Uncertain", "Let's think step by step.

Bonnie either both attends and is very engaged with school events and is a student who attends the school, or she neither attends and is very engaged with school events nor is a student who attends the school.\n\nLet's consider the two possible scenarios for Bonnie:\n\nScenario 1: Bonnie attends and is very engaged with school events and is a student who attends the school. In this case, she doesn't chaperone high school dances, and the conclusion doesn't hold.\n\nScenario 2: Bonnie neither attends and is very engaged with school events nor is a student who attends the school. In this case, since she doesn't attend school, she can chaperone high school dances without contradicting the other premises. The conclusion holds in this case.\n\nSince both scenarios are possible, the statement is uncertain given the premises.\n\nANSWER: Uncertain", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate the given conclusion. From the premises, we know that people who perform in school talent shows often attend and are very engaged with school events. Also, people who are inactive and disinterested members of their community chaperone high school dances. We also know that Bonnie either attends and is very engaged with school events and is a student who attends the school, or she neither attends and is very engaged with school events nor is a student who attends the school.\n\nFrom the conclusion, we need to find a scenario where Bonnie is either a student who attends the school or is an inactive and disinterested member of the community. If Bonnie is a student who attends the school, then she performs in school talent shows often and is very engaged with school events. However, this scenario doesn't meet the condition where she also chaperones high school dances.\n\nLet's consider another scenario where Bonnie is not a student who attends the school. In this case, she is inactive and disinterested in school events, but she chaperones high school dances, as per the premises. Therefore, the conclusion is true for this scenario.\n\nHowever, there is no information in the premises about whether Bonnie is a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities. So, the conclusion could be true, but it is uncertain because we don't have enough information about Bonnie's age and intentions regarding her education.\n\nANSWER:\tUncertain (with the given information)", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate the statement \"If Bonnie is either both a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities and chaperones high school dances or neither is a young child nor teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities, then Bonnie is either a student who attends the school or is an inactive and disinterested member of the community.\"\n\nFirst, let's consider the case where Bonnie is a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities and chaperones high school dances. From the premises, we know that if people chaperone high school dances, then they are not students who attend the school. However, we also know that young children and teenagers who wish to further their academic careers and educational opportunities are students who attend the school. This means that it is impossible for Bonnie to be both a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities and chaperones high school dances.\n\nNext, let's consider the case where Bonnie is neither a young child nor teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities. In this case, we know that all people who are inactive and disinterested members of their community chaperone high school dances. Therefore, in this case, Bonnie would be an inactive and disinterested member of the community.\n\nSince it is impossible for Bonnie to be both a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities and chaperones high school dances, and since in the other case, Bonnie would be an inactive and disinterested member of the community, the statement is true.\n\nANSWER: True", "Let's think step by step.

Bonnie is either both a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities and chaperones high school dances or neither is a young child nor teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities.\n2. If Bonnie is a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities and chaperones high school dances, then she is a student who attends the school (by premise 5).\n3. If Bonnie is not a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities, then she is an inactive and disinterested member of the community (by premise 4).\n\nNow, let's consider the different scenarios for Bonnie:\n\nScenario 1: Bonnie is both a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities and chaperones high school dances. In this case, by rule 2, Bonnie is a student who attends the school.\n\nScenario 2: Bonnie is neither a young child nor teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities. In this case, by rule 3, Bonnie is an inactive and disinterested member of the community.\n\nSince both scenarios satisfy the conditions in the conclusion, the statement is true.\nANSWER: True", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate the statement about Bonnie. From the given premises, we know that there are two possible scenarios for Bonnie:\n\n1. Bonnie is a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities and chaperones high school dances. In this case, since she chaperones high school dances, she is not a student who attends the school (from the premise that people who chaperone high school dances are not students who attend the school). However, from the premise that inactive and disinterested members of the community chaperone high school dances, we can infer that Bonnie is an inactive and disinterested member of the community.\n\n2. Bonnie is neither a young child nor teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities nor is a student who attends the school. In this case, since she is neither a student nor wishes to further her academic career, she is not involved in school events, and thus, is not very engaged with school events. Since she is not a student, we don't have information about her community involvement, so we can't say if she is an inactive and disinterested member of the community or not.\n\nIn both scenarios, it is not guaranteed that Bonnie is either a student who attends the school or an inactive and disinterested member of the community. The conclusion is not necessarily true, so the statement is uncertain given the premises.\n\nANSWER: Uncertain", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if Bonnie is either a student who attends the school or is an inactive and disinterested member of the community.

From the premises, we know that people who chaperone high school dances are not students who attend the school. However, since Bonnie is a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities, she must be a student who attends the school according to the last premise. This is a contradiction, so this scenario is impossible.\n\nNext, let's assume Bonnie is neither a young child nor teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities. From the second premise, we know that people who are inactive and disinterested members of their community chaperone high school dances.

This contradicts the first premise, so our assumption that James is not a manager is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, our original assumption that James is either a manager and appears in the company today or neither a manager nor appears in the company today is correct.

However, since James is either a manager and appears in the company today or neither a manager nor appears in the company today (according to the last premise), it is not clear whether James schedules meetings with his customers or not. Therefore, we cannot determine whether James has lunch in the company or not. However, we do know that if James is working remotely from home, he will not have lunch in the company. Since we don't know whether James is a manager or not, we also don't know whether he is in other countries or not.

However, we also know that if an employee has lunch at home, then he/she is working remotely from home. Moreover, we know that no managers work remotely from home. Since James is either a manager and appears in the company today or neither a manager nor appears in the company today, we can deduce that if James appears in the company today, he is not a manager and therefore not working remotely. Therefore, if James appears in the company today, he would have lunch in the company, and if he does not appear in the company today, it is possible that he has lunch at home, but since managers cannot work remotely, James cannot have lunch at home.

If he is a manager, then he cannot be in the company for lunch because no managers work remotely from home. However, we don't know if he has lunch at home or in the company if he is not in the company today.\n\nSo, we cannot definitively say that James does not have lunch in the company. It is uncertain whether James does not have lunch in the company.\n\nANSWER: Uncertain", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if James does not have lunch in the company. From the premises, we know that everyone who has lunch in the company schedules meetings with their customers. We also know that employees will either have lunch in the company or have lunch at home. If an employee has lunch at home, then he/she is working remotely from home, but we know that no managers work remotely from home. Since James is either a manager or not a manager, and we know that he is not in the company today (since employees who schedule a meeting with their customers will appear in the company today), it means that he is not a manager. Therefore, he is working remotely from home, which means he has lunch at home and not in the company. So the statement is true.\nANSWER:\tTrue", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if James does not have lunch in the company.\n\nFirst, let's consider the possible scenarios for James:\n1. James is a manager and appears in the company today. In this case, James has lunch in the company, so this scenario contradicts the conclusion.\n2. James is not a manager and does not appear in the company today. In this case, we don't know if James has lunch in the company or at home, so this scenario does not allow us to conclude that James does not have lunch in the company.\n\nHowever, we know that if James has lunch at home, he is working remotely from home. Since no managers work remotely from home, and the premises do not mention any other scenarios for James, it is reasonable to assume that James is not a manager and does not appear in the company today.\n\nIn this scenario, James could have lunch in the company or at home. However, the only information we have about James's lunch is that if he has lunch at home, he is working remotely from home. Since the premises do not tell us anything about James working remotely from home, we cannot conclude that James does not have lunch in the company. Therefore, the statement is uncertain.\n\nANSWER: Uncertain", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if James does not have lunch in the company. From the given premises, we know that if an employee has lunch at home, then he/she is working remotely from home. We also know that no managers work remotely from home. From the last premise, we know that James is either a manager and appears in the company today or neither a manager nor appears in the company today.\n\nSince James is either a manager and appears in the company today or neither a manager nor appears in the company today, we can infer that James is not working remotely from home, because if he were, he would be a manager, which contradicts the given information.\n\nNow, let's consider the case where James appears in the company today. In this case, everyone who has lunch in the company schedules meetings with their customers. Since James appears in the company today, he might have lunch in the company, but we don't have any information about whether he schedules meetings with his customers or not.\n\nHowever, if James does not appear in the company today, then he is neither a manager nor appears in the company, which means he works remotely from home. In this case, if he has lunch at home, then he is working remotely from home, which contradicts the information we have about him not being a manager.\n\nSo, to avoid this contradiction, we can infer that James has lunch in the company. However, since we don't know for sure whether he schedules meetings with his customers or not, the conclusion is uncertain given the premises.\n\nANSWER: Uncertain", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if James does not have lunch in the company. From the last premise, we know that James is either a manager and appears in the company today or neither a manager nor appears in the company today. If James appears in the company today, then he schedules a meeting with his customers (from the first premise), and since everyone who schedules meetings with their customers has lunch in the company (from the second premise), this means that if James appears in the company today, he has lunch in the company.\n\nNow, let's consider the case where James is not a manager. In this case, he is neither working in the company nor working remotely from home (from the fourth premise). Since he is not working in the company, this means that he is not having lunch in the company (since employees only have lunch in the company if they are working there).\n\nTherefore, if James is not a manager, he does not have lunch in the company. Since we have shown that if James appears in the company today, he has lunch in the company, and we have also shown that if James is not a manager, he does not have lunch in the company, it follows that if James does not appear in the company today, he does not have lunch in the company.\n\nHowever, we don't know whether James appears in the company today or not, since the premises don't give us that information. Therefore, even though it is true that if James does not appear in the company today, he does not have lunch in the company, we cannot conclude that James does not have lunch in the company, since we don't know whether he appears in the company today or not.\n\nIn conclusion, the statement \"James does not have lunch in the company\" is uncertain given the premises.\n\nANSWER: Uncertain."], "answers": ["Uncertain", "True", "Uncertain", "True", "True", "Uncertain", "True", "Uncertain", "Uncertain", "Uncertain"], "reference": "Uncertain", "time_total": 35.24326157569885, "time_llm": 35.24218821525574, "prompt_length": 8913}

James is in other countries: In this case, James works remotely from home (premise 5). Since he's working remotely, he doesn't have lunch in the company.

However, we also know from the second premise that all games in the Top 10 list are made by Japanese game companies, and from the first premise, we know that the game The Legend of Zelda was created by a Japanese game company. Therefore, since The Legend of Zelda meets the criteria for being in the Top 10 list and is made by a Japanese game company, it must be in the Top 10 list, so the conclusion is false.\nANSWER:\tFalse", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if The Legend of Zelda is in the Top 10 list.

However, we also know that if a game sells more than one million copies, then it will be selected into the Top 10 list. Since The Legend of Zelda sold more than one million copies, it should be in the Top 10 list. Therefore, there seems to be a contradiction between the fact that The Legend of Zelda is a Japanese game and it's not in the Top 10 list. This contradiction suggests that the statement is false.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that the premises don't exclude the possibility that there are other games on the Top 10 list that were not created by Japanese game companies.

Since Karen does not binge-watch \"Black Mirror\", it is not popular for her, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's not popular in general.

Since Karen does not download \"Black Mirror\", she cannot have binge-watched it. But since she shares it with Lisa, this means that \"Black Mirror\" must have been binge-watched by someone else. Therefore, \"Black Mirror\" is popular, but it is not necessarily popular with Karen.\n\nHowever, we do not have enough information to definitively say that Karen would binge-watch \"Black Mirror\" if it were popular. Therefore, we cannot conclude that \"Black Mirror\" being popular is the only reason Karen does not download it.

However, we don't know which one is the case, so we can't conclude that she has lost to Rafael Nadal directly.\n\nNow, let's examine the information about female tennis players at Roland Garros 2022. From the third premise, we know that all female tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 lost to Iga \u015awi\u0105tek, but we don't know if any of them lost to Rafael Nadal as well. If Coco Gauff is one of the female tennis players at Roland Garros 2022, then we can't determine whether she lost to Rafael Nadal or not based on the given information.\n\nHowever, we can make an indirect conclusion by considering the implications of our previous observation. If Coco Gauff is a player who is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association, then she wouldn't be a female tennis player at Roland Garros 2022 because all of them lost to Iga \u015awi\u0105tek. Therefore, if Coco Gauff is a player who is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association, then she must have lost to someone else. Since we don't know if Coco Gauff is a female tennis player at Roland Garros 2022, we still can't conclude that she has lost to Rafael Nadal directly.\n\nIn conclusion, we can't determine whether Coco Gauff has lost to Rafael Nadal based on the given information, so the statement is uncertain.\n\nANSWER: Uncertain", "Let's think step by step.

However, we also know that if something is a bovine, then it is domesticated, and no domesticated animals are alligators, and Ted is an alligator.\n\nFrom this information, we can deduce that Ted is not a cow, because if Ted were a cow, he would be domesticated, which contradicts the fact that he is an alligator.\n\nNow, we want to see if Ted being not a cow implies that Ted is not a pet. Since Ted is not a cow, we don't have enough information to determine if Ted is a pet or not, because there might be other pets that are not cows. Therefore, it is uncertain if \"If Ted is a cow, then Ted is not a pet\" is true.\n\nHowever, we do know that Ted is not a pet, because he is an alligator, and we can conclude that from the given premises. So, although the conclusion is uncertain given the premises, we can deduce that \"Ted is not a pet\" is true.\n\nSo, the answer is: ANSWER: Uncertain for the conclusion \"If Ted is a cow, then Ted is not a pet,\" but ANSWER: True for the fact \"Ted is not a pet.\"", "Let's think step by step.

Similarly, if KO is a growth company\u2019s stock, it would not be suitable for a retirement fund (again according to the second premise), but it would not be a mature company\u2019s stock either, creating another contradiction.

However, the conclusion does not state that KO is not suitable for a retirement fund, so even if the stock price is volatile, the conclusion does not follow logically from this premise.\n\nSince one part of the conclusion is false, and the other part is not logically connected to any premise, the overall conclusion is uncertain given the provided premises.\n\nANSWER: Uncertain", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate the statement \"If KO is a growth company\u2019s stock or if its price is volatile, then KO is neither a company\u2019s stock nor is its price volatile.\" This statement is saying that if KO is a growth company's stock (which we don't know) or if its price is volatile (which we also don't know), then KO cannot be a company's stock, and its price cannot be volatile. However, since we don't have information about whether KO is a growth company's stock or if its price is volatile, we cannot determine whether the statement is true or false.

We want to evaluate the statement \"If KO is a growth company\u2019s stock or if its price is volatile, then KO is neither a company\u2019s stock nor is its price volatile.\" We know that KO is a mature company's stock, and therefore, its stock is suitable for a retirement fund. From the second premise, we know that if the stock price is volatile, then it is not suitable for a retirement fund. However, we don't have any information about whether KO's price is volatile or not. Therefore, we cannot conclude that KO is neither a company\u2019s stock nor is its price volatile, as the premises do not provide enough information to make this conclusion.

Therefore, KO is a company's stock.\n\nSecond, we know that all growth companies\u2019 stocks are volatile, but we don't know if KO is a growth company\u2019s stock or not. However, since KO is a mature company\u2019s stock, we know it is not a growth company\u2019s stock.\n\nThird, we know that if the stock price is volatile, then it is not suitable for a retirement fund, but we know that KO's stock is suitable for a retirement fund, so its price is not volatile.\n\nTherefore, since KO is a company's stock (because it is a mature company's stock) and its price is not volatile (because it is suitable for a retirement fund), the conclusion does not follow from the premises.\n\nANSWER: False", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate the statement \"If KO is a growth company\u2019s stock or if its price is volatile, then KO is neither a company\u2019s stock nor is its price volatile.\" We know that KO is a mature company's stock from the premises, so it is not a growth company's stock.

If Peter spills a lot of food on his clothing, then by the first premise, he does not tidy his spaces consistently and enjoys the process of cleaning. However, the premises do not tell us anything about whether Peter goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try or if he belongs to a household with a high net income.\n\nLet's consider the second case. If Peter did not spill a lot of food on his clothing and did not grow up as an only child with no siblings, then he is neither a person who spills a lot of food on his clothing nor grew up as an only child with no siblings. Again, the premises do not tell us anything about whether Peter goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try or if he belongs to a household with a high net income.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude that Peter is either a foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try or belongs to a household with a high net income based on the given premises.\n\nANSWER: Uncertain", "Let's think step by step.

We know that all foodies who go out frequently to find new food restaurants to try are people who spill a lot of food on their clothing (from the second premise). If Peter is a person who spills a lot of food on his clothing, then he is a foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try.\n\nNow, let's consider the second part of the conclusion. We know that all households with a high net income have people who have parents who are very busy with their regular jobs (from the fifth premise). If Peter belongs to a household with a high net income, then he has parents who are very busy with their regular jobs. However, we don't know yet whether Peter himself belongs to this category or not, because we don't know whether Peter grew up as an only child with no siblings (from the fourth premise).\n\nSince we don't know if Peter grew up as an only child with no siblings, we can't definitively say whether he belongs to a household with a high net income or not. However, if Peter is a person who spills a lot of food on his clothing (which we know from the last premise), then he is a foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try, satisfying the first part of the conclusion.

We want to evaluate if Peter is either a foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try or belongs to a household with a high net income.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the scenario where Peter spills a lot of food on his clothing. From the premises, we know that all foodies who go out frequently to find new food restaurants to try are people who spill a lot of food on their clothing. If Peter is a foodie, then he would belong to this category, and we would know that he is either a foodie or from a household with a high net income.\n\nHowever, we don't have enough information to determine if Peter is a foodie. From the premises, we know that if people spill a lot of food on their clothing, then they do not tidy their spaces consistently and enjoy the process of cleaning. But we don't have any information about Peter's tidiness or his enjoyment of cleaning.\n\nSo, let's analyze the scenario where Peter didn't spill a lot of food on his clothing. From the premises, we know that if Peter didn't spill a lot of food on his clothing, then he is not necessarily a foodie. But we also know that if Peter didn't spill a lot of food on his clothing, it doesn't mean that he grew up as an only child with no siblings either.\n\nNow, let's consider the households with a high net income. From the premises, we know that all households with a high net income have people who have parents who are very busy with their regular jobs. But we don't know if Peter is from such a household or not.\n\nSince we don't have enough information to determine if Peter is a foodie or from a household with a high net income, we cannot conclusively say that Peter is either a foodie or belongs to a household with a high net income.

From the last premise, we know that Peter is either both a person who spills a lot of food on his clothing and grew up as an only child with no siblings, or he is neither a person who spills a lot of food on his clothing nor grew up as an only child with no siblings.\n\nLet's assume Peter is the former: he spills a lot of food on his clothing and grew up as an only child with no siblings. From the second premise, if Peter spills a lot of food on his clothing, then he is a foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try. From the fifth premise, if Peter grew up as an only child with no siblings, then his household has a high net income. Therefore, in this case, Peter is both a foodie and from a household with a high net income.\n\nLet's assume Peter is the latter: he is neither a person who spills a lot of food on his clothing nor grew up as an only child with no siblings. In this case, we don't have any information about whether Peter is a foodie or from a household with a high net income, so it is uncertain whether Peter is either a foodie or from a household with a high net income.\n\nSince we have two possible scenarios (one where Peter is a foodie and one where it is uncertain), we cannot definitively say that Peter is either a foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try or belongs to a household with a high net income.

Therefore, Peter is a foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try and belongs to a household with a high net income.\n\nIf Peter is neither a person who spills a lot of food on his clothing nor grew up as an only child with no siblings, then he is neither a foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try nor belongs to a household with a high net income (since the fifth premise states that all households with a high net income have people who have parents who are very busy with their regular jobs, and we know that Peter did not grow up as an only child with no siblings).\n\nTherefore, Peter is either a foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try and belongs to a household with a high net income or he is neither a foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try nor belongs to a household with a high net income, so the statement is true.\n\nANSWER: True", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate the statement \"Peter is either a foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try and belongs to a household with a high net income or he is a foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try nor belongs to a household with a high net income.\"\n\nFirst, let's consider the possibility that Peter is a foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try. From the premises, we know that if Peter is a foodie, then he spills a lot of food on his clothing. However, we don't know if Peter grew up as an only child with no siblings, which might affect his tidiness and enjoyment of cleaning. If Peter is a foodie, we also don't know if his household has a high net income.\n\nNext, let's consider the possibility that Peter is neither a foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try nor grew up as an only child with no siblings. From the premises, we know that if Peter is neither a foodie nor grew up as an only child with no siblings, then he doesn't spill a lot of food on his clothing. However, we don't know if his household has a high net income.\n\nSince we don't have enough information to determine if Peter belongs to a household with a high net income, we cannot definitively say whether the statement is true or false. We can only say that it is uncertain given the premises.\n\nANSWER: Uncertain", "Let's think step by step.

However, the premises do not tell us anything about Peter's household income. Therefore, we don't know if Peter is a foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try and belongs to a household with a high net income or if he is a foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try nor belongs to a household with a high net income. It is uncertain whether the conclusion follows from the premises.\n\nANSWER: Uncertain", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate the statement about Peter. From the last premise, we know that Peter is either both a person who spills a lot of food on his clothing and grew up as an only child with no siblings, or he is neither a person who spills a lot of food on his clothing nor grew up as an only child with no siblings.\n\nLet's consider the first possibility, that Peter is both a person who spills a lot of food on his clothing and grew up as an only child with no siblings. From the first premise, we know that if people spill a lot of food on their clothing, then they do not tidy their spaces consistently and enjoy the process of cleaning. From the third premise, we know that if people grew up as only children with no siblings, then they tidy their spaces consistently and enjoy the process of cleaning. Since these two statements contradict each other, this possibility is not possible, so Peter cannot be both a person who spills a lot of food on his clothing and grew up as an only child with no siblings.\n\nTherefore, Peter must be neither a person who spills a lot of food on his clothing nor grew up as an only child with no siblings. This means that he is neither a foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try nor belongs to a household with a high net income, which contradicts the conclusion.\n\nSince the conclusion contradicts the premises, it is false.\nANSWER:\tFalse", "Let's think step by step.

From the fifth premise, we know that all households with a high net income have people who have parents who are very busy with their regular jobs. Therefore, if Peter is an only child and his parents are very busy, then his household has a high net income.\n\nCombining the information, if Peter is a foodie who spills a lot of food on his clothing and grew up as an only child with no siblings, then he does not tidy his spaces consistently and enjoys the process of cleaning, and his household has a high net income.\n\nIf Peter is neither a person who spills a lot of food on his clothing nor grew up as an only child with no siblings, then he neither does not tidy his spaces consistently and enjoys the process of cleaning nor belongs to a household with a high net income.\n\nTherefore, Peter is either a foodie who spills a lot of food on his clothing and belongs to a household with a high net income, or he is neither a foodie nor belongs to a household with a high net income.

Since the Harding Pegmatite Mine is located in the Picuris Mountains and the only other option for the location of the Picuris Mountains is Texas, where we know there are no mountain ranges with donated mines, it follows that the Harding Pegmatite Mine must be located in a mountain range in New Mexico. Therefore, the conclusion is false.\nANSWER:\tFalse", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if the Harding Pegmatite Mine is not located in a mountain range in New Mexico. From the premises, we know that the Picuris Mountains are the only mountain range that the Harding Pegmatite Mine could be located in, according to the first premise. However, we also know that there are no mountain ranges in Texas that have mines which have been donated. Since the Picuris Mountains are located in New Mexico, if there were a mine in the Picuris Mountains that had been donated, it would be in a mountain range in New Mexico, which contradicts the last premise.

Since there are no mountain ranges in Texas that have mines which have been donated, and we know that the Harding Pegmatite Mine was donated, it must be located in the Picuris Mountains, which are in New Mexico. Therefore, our initial assumption that the Picuris Mountains are in New Mexico or Texas is correct. However, we are asked to determine if the Harding Pegmatite Mine is not located in a mountain range in New Mexico, and since it is indeed located in the Picuris Mountains, which are in New Mexico, this means it is not the case that the Harding Pegmatite Mine is not located in a mountain range in New Mexico.

We know that Juan de Onate visited the Picuris Mountains, which are a mountain range. We also know that the Harding Pegmatite Mine is located in the Picuris Mountains. However, we also know that there are no mountain ranges in Texas that have mines which have been donated. Since the Picuris Mountains are in New Mexico, not Texas, and since there are no mountain ranges in Texas with donated mines, it is safe to conclude that the Harding Pegmatite Mine is not located in a mountain range in New Mexico.

If she is a student, then we know from the third premise that she must either study or teach. However, we know she is not a teacher, so she must study. Therefore, Rose is a student.

We want to evaluate if it is not true that Rose is a student and Jerry is a human. From the premises, we know that all students are humans, so if Rose is a student, then she is a human.

Therefore, if Rose is a student and Jerry is a human, the statement would be false, but since we know that Jerry is a student, the statement must be false in the opposite direction, meaning it is true that Rose is a student and Jerry is a human.\n\nHowever, there seems to be a mistake in the conclusion. The conclusion states that it is not true that Rose is a student and Jerry is a human, but we have shown that it is actually true that Rose is a student and Jerry is a human.

However, we don't have any information about Rose's studying habits.\n\nWe do know that Rose is either young or a student.

Since Rose is either young or a student, and she doesn't teach, it follows that Rose is a student. Therefore, it is not true that Rose is not a student.\n\nWe don't have any information about Jerry's humanity in the given premises, so we can't make a conclusion about Jerry being a human or not.\n\nTherefore, the statement \"It is not true that Rose is a student and Jerry is a human\" is false, because it is not true that Rose is not a student. The statement about Jerry's humanity is uncertain given the premises.\n\nANSWER:\tUncertain (for Jerry's humanity) and False (for the statement about Rose and Jerry)", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if it is not true that Rose is a student and Jerry is a human. First, let's consider Rose. From the premises, we know that a person either studies or teaches. Since we know that Jerry neither teaches nor is a manager, this means Jerry does not study, and therefore, Rose could still be a student.\n\nNext, let's consider Jerry. From the premises, we know that no young person teaches, and we know that Jerry neither teaches nor is a manager. This means that Jerry must not be young, but this doesn't necessarily mean he is not a human.\n\nSince we have not found a contradiction for either Rose or Jerry, it is uncertain if it is not true that Rose is a student and Jerry is a human. Therefore, the conclusion is uncertain given the premises.\n\nANSWER:\tUncertain", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if it is not true that Rose is a student and Jerry is a human.\n\nFrom the premises, we know that a person either studies or teaches, and no young person teaches. So, if Rose is young, then she does not teach. Also, we know that Jerry neither teaches nor is a manager.\n\nNow, let's consider the possibility that Rose is a student. If Rose is a student, then she studies, which means she is a human (since all students are humans). On the other hand, if Jerry is a human, then he either studies or teaches, but we know he doesn't teach, so he must study. However, we don't know whether he is a student or not, as we only know he doesn't teach.\n\nIn summary, we can't definitively say that it is not true that Rose is a student and Jerry is a human because we don't know whether Jerry is a student or not.

From the premises, we know that if Remy goes to bed late and wakes up every day after noon, then they do not spend their free time tidying and organizing the spaces in their home (premise 5). Therefore, in this scenario, Remy neither spends their free time tidying and organizing the spaces in their home nor has a fully stocked and impressive home office.\n\nNow, let's assume that Remy visits the office supply store regularly. Since Remy has a large desktop monitor at home (implied by owning a home office), and they work regularly and often at home (implied by having a large desktop monitor), they do not visit the office supply store regularly (contradicts premise 4). This means that in this scenario, Remy neither visits the office supply store regularly nor spends their free time tidying and organizing the spaces in their home, and they have a home office (contradicts the conclusion).\n\nSince both of our assumptions lead to contradictions, the conclusion is not always true.

We want to evaluate if colorectal cancer is a bile duct cancer or a Cholangiocarcinoma given that it is not a mild flu.\n\nFrom the premises, we know that if something is a deadly disease, then its survival rate is low. We also know that all severe cancers are deadly diseases. We know that bile duct cancer is a severe cancer, and all Cholangiocarcinoma is bile duct cancer.\n\nFrom the premise that no one with mild flu has a low survival rate, we can infer that colorectal cancer is not a mild flu (since its survival rate is not low).\n\nNow, let's assume colorectal cancer is not a bile duct cancer. From the premise that if colorectal cancer is a bile duct cancer and the survival rate is low, then colorectal cancer is not a bile duct cancer, this assumption would be correct.

This means that colorectal cancer is neither a bile duct cancer nor a Cholangiocarcinoma according to the premises, which contradicts the statement. Therefore, the statement is false.\nANSWER:\tFalse\n\nTo clarify, the premises state that all Cholangiocarcinoma is bile duct cancer, and all severe cancers are deadly diseases with a low survival rate. The statement, however, assumes that colorectal cancer can be both a bile duct cancer and a Cholangiocarcinoma, which contradicts the premises that Cholangiocarcinoma is a specific type of bile duct cancer.", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate the statement \"If colorectal cancer is not a mild flu and a Cholangiocarcinoma, then colorectal cancer is a bile duct cancer or a Cholangiocarcinoma.\" To do this, let's consider two cases:\n\n1. Case 1: Colorectal cancer is a Cholangiocarcinoma. In this case, the statement is false because we know that colorectal cancer is a Cholangiocarcinoma, which is a bile duct cancer, and the statement states that it is either a bile duct cancer or a Cholangiocarcinoma.\n\n2. Case 2: Colorectal cancer is not a Cholangiocarcinoma. In this case, the statement is true because we don't have any information that colorectal cancer is a bile duct cancer, so it could be either a bile duct cancer or not a bile duct cancer, but it is not a Cholangiocarcinoma.\n\nSince Case 2 is a valid scenario where the statement is true, the statement is not necessarily false, and it could be uncertain if more information about colorectal cancer was provided. However, in the context of the given premises, the statement is true.\n\nANSWER: True\n\nNote: This problem can be made clearer by rephrasing the conclusion to \"If colorectal cancer is not a Cholangiocarcinoma, then colorectal cancer is not a bile duct cancer.\" In this case, the statement would be uncertain due to the premise that all Cholangiocarcinoma is bile duct cancer.", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if colorectal cancer is not a bile duct cancer or a Cholangiocarcinoma given that it is not a mild flu. From the premises, we know that if something is a deadly disease (which includes severe cancers), its survival rate is low. We also know that all Cholangiocarcinoma is bile duct cancer. Therefore, if colorectal cancer is a bile duct cancer, then its survival rate would be low because it is a severe cancer. However, the premise states that if colorectal cancer is a bile duct cancer and its survival rate is low, then it is not a bile duct cancer. This creates a contradiction.\n\nTo resolve the contradiction, we can consider the opposite case: if colorectal cancer is not a bile duct cancer, then its survival rate might not necessarily be low, depending on the specific type of colorectal cancer. In this case, the colorectal cancer could be a different type of severe cancer, or it could not be a severe cancer at all.

If colorectal cancer were a Cholangiocarcinoma, then it would be a bile duct cancer. However, from the last premise, we know that if colorectal cancer is a bile duct cancer and has a low survival rate, then it is not a bile duct cancer. Since we know that colorectal cancer is not a mild flu, and we don't know its survival rate, we can't conclude whether it has a low survival rate or not.

Therefore, the given assumption must be false, meaning colorectal cancer cannot be not a mild flu and not a Cholangiocarcinoma. Since we assumed colorectal cancer is not a Cholangiocarcinoma, this means colorectal cancer must be a Cholangiocarcinoma, which is the same as saying colorectal cancer is bile duct cancer because all Cholangiocarcinoma is bile duct cancer.

If Tom is not mean to animals, we know he loves animals because he owns a pet. But we can't conclude that Tom is not grumpy based on the information given.\n\nNow, let's consider a scenario where Tom is not mean to animals, but he is grumpy. In this case, the statement \"If Tom is not a grumpy person and mean to animals, then Tom is neither a grumpy person nor an Animal Lover\" would be false because Tom would be a grumpy person in this scenario.\n\nHowever, we can't definitively say that the statement is true because we don't know if Tom is grumpy or not if he is not mean to animals.

Since no one nice to animals is mean to animals, this means Tom is not mean to animals.\n\nFrom premise 3, we know that all animal lovers are nice to animals. Since Tom is nice to animals, he must be an animal lover.\n\nHowever, we don't have any information about whether Tom is grumpy or not, so it is possible that Tom is grumpy, but we don't know for sure.

Therefore, there must be an error in the premises, and it is uncertain if Steinhauer was the winner of the 1992 du Maurier Classic.\n\nANSWER: Uncertain", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if Steinhauer was not the winner of the 1992 du Maurier Classic. From the premises, we know that there was a six-way tie on the leaderboard, and one of the six was from Belgium. We also know that Descampe is from Belgium and is on the leaderboard of the 1992 du Maurier Classic. Since all people on the leaderboard participated in the tournament, and Steinhauer participated, we can infer that Steinhauer was also on the leaderboard. However, since we know that one of the six in the tie was from Belgium and we know that Descampe is from Belgium, it means that Steinhauer cannot be the winner because there was a tie, and each of the six winners shares the prize. Therefore, Steinhauer was not the winner of the 1992 du Maurier Classic, so the statement is true.\nANSWER:\tTrue", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if Steinhauer was not the winner of the 1992 du Maurier Classic. From the premises, we know that there was a six-way tie on the leaderboard and one person in the six-way tie was from Belgium. Since Descampe is from Belgium and is on the leaderboard, it means that Descampe was one of the six tied for the first place. However, we don't know whether Steinhauer was also among the six. Therefore, it is uncertain whether Steinhauer was the winner or not, and hence it is uncertain if Steinhauer was not the winner.\n\nHowever, let's consider another scenario. If Steinhauer was the only one from the six who was not from Belgium, then they could not have been in the six-way tie. Since Descampe is from Belgium and is on the leaderboard, this means that Steinhauer was not the winner of the 1992 du Maurier Classic. Therefore, the statement is true in this alternate scenario.\n\nSo, the conclusion is uncertain given the premises, but could be true depending on whether Steinhauer was among the six tied for the first place or not. It is important to note that the premises do not provide enough information to definitively answer the question.\n\nANSWER:\tUncertain (but could be True)", "Let's think step by step.

Since Descampe is on the leaderboard, we know that Descampe participated in the 1992 du Maurier Classic (from the last premise). However, we don't know if Descampe was the winner or not. But since we know that Steinhauer was the winner, and Descampe was also on the leaderboard, it means that Steinhauer and Descampe are two different people, and Steinhauer could not be the winner of the 1992 du Maurier Classic for Descampe.

Since Steinhauer is the winner, they are not among the tied players. Therefore, if Descampe is one of the tied players, then Steinhauer cannot be the winner.

We also know that if KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous or has legs. Since we know that KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, it must be the case that either KiKi is terricolous or it has legs but doesn't jump.

First, let's consider the case where KiKi neither jumps nor has legs. This means that KiKi is not an animal that jumps, and since if an animal jumps, Jane likes it, we know that Jane does not like KiKi. From the first premise, if Jane does not like KiKi, then KiKi barks. Now, since KiKi is a dog (from the second premise), dogs are animals that bark, and KiKi is one of them, so KiKi barks.

However, we are asked to conclude if KiKi is terricolous, not if it has legs. Since we know that if an animal is terricolous, it jumps, and KiKi doesn't jump, we can conclude that KiKi is not terricolous, but it may have legs.

However, we do know that if KiKi is terricolous, it has legs (from the premises that if an animal is terricolous, then it has legs).

The statement is true.\n\nANSWER: True", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if KiKi neither barks nor is a dog. From the premises, we know that all dogs are animals that bark. So, if KiKi is a dog, it would bark. But we know that if an animal barks, then Jane does not like it, and we are not given any information about Jane's feelings towards KiKi. This means that KiKi might still be a dog even though we don't know if Jane likes it or not.\n\nNow, let's consider the other possibility: KiKi does not bark. From the premises, we know that if an animal jumps, then Jane likes it. We also know that if an animal has legs, then it jumps, and if an animal is terricolous, then it has legs. So, if KiKi does not bark, it must either not jump (and thus Jane might not like it) or not have legs (and thus it might not be terricolous).\n\nHowever, we also know that if KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous or has legs. This means that if KiKi does not bark, it might not jump, but it could still have legs, and thus it could be terricolous.\n\nIn summary, we don't know for sure if KiKi is a dog because we don't know if Jane likes dogs or not. And we don't know for sure if KiKi is not a dog because it might still have legs and be terricolous. Therefore, it is uncertain whether KiKi neither barks nor is a dog.\n\nANSWER: Uncertain.", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if KiKi neither barks nor is a dog. From the premises, we know that all dogs bark. Therefore, if KiKi is a dog, it would bark. Since we know that Jane doesn't like animals that bark (from the first premise), this means that if KiKi is a dog, Jane doesn't like KiKi. However, the conclusion doesn't say anything about Jane's feelings towards KiKi.\n\nTo evaluate if KiKi neither barks nor is a dog, we need to consider other possible cases. From the premises, we know that if an animal jumps, Jane likes it, and if an animal has legs, it jumps and if it is terricolous, it has legs. From these premises, we can deduce that if an animal is terricolous and has legs, it jumps and Jane likes it.\n\nNow, if KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, we don't know if KiKi is terricolous or not (from the fifth premise). If KiKi is not terricolous, it means it doesn't have legs (since if it has legs, it jumps). In this case, we don't have enough information to determine if KiKi is a dog or not. However, since all dogs bark and KiKi doesn't bark, it is certain that KiKi is not a dog.\n\nTherefore, the statement is true that KiKi is not a dog, but we can't conclude anything about whether KiKi barks or not based on the given premises.\n\nANSWER:\tTrue (for the first part), Uncertain (for the second part)", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if KiKi neither barks nor is a dog. First, we know that all dogs are animals that bark, so if KiKi is a dog, it barks. However, we are given that if an animal barks, then Jane does not like it, which means that if KiKi is a dog, then Jane does not like it. But we don't know anything about Jane's feelings towards KiKi, so we cannot conclude anything about whether KiKi is a dog or not based on this information.\n\nHowever, let's consider the other properties. We know that if an animal jumps, then Jane likes it. We also know that if an animal has legs, then it jumps, and if an animal is terricolous, then it has legs. If KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then it is either not terricolous or not having legs, but we are told that if KiKi is not terricolous, then it has legs, so KiKi must be terricolous. Since it is terricolous, it has legs, and therefore, it jumps. But we know that if an animal jumps, then Jane likes it, which means that Jane likes KiKi. However, we don't have any information about whether KiKi barks or not.\n\nIn summary, we cannot conclude anything about whether KiKi is a dog or not based on the given information, but we can conclude that KiKi is terricolous, has legs, and jumps, and Jane likes it.

We want to evaluate if KiKi neither barks nor is a dog.\n\nFrom the premises, we know that if an animal barks, then Jane does not like it, and all dogs are animals that bark. So, if KiKi barks, Jane does not like it. But, since we don't know if KiKi is a dog, we don't know if KiKi barks.\n\nHowever, we also know that if an animal jumps, then Jane likes it, and if an animal has legs, then it jumps, and if an animal is terricolous, then it has legs. So, if KiKi has legs, it jumps, and if it jumps, Jane likes it.\n\nFrom the last premise, we know that if KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous or has legs. This creates a contradiction with the previous information, because if KiKi has legs, it should jump and be liked by Jane.\n\nSince we have a contradiction in the premises, we cannot determine whether KiKi neither barks nor is a dog. The statement is uncertain.\n\nANSWER: Uncertain", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if KiKi neither barks nor is a dog. From the second premise, we know that all dogs are animals that bark. If KiKi barks, then according to the first premise, Jane does not like it, but we are not given any information about whether Jane likes KiKi or not. Therefore, it is uncertain whether KiKi barks or not. However, from the fourth premise, we know that if an animal jumps, then Jane likes it. From the fifth premise, we know that if an animal has legs, then it jumps. From the sixth premise, we know that if an animal is terricolous, then it has legs. From the seventh premise, we know that if KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then it is terricolous or has legs. However, we cannot determine whether KiKi is terricolous or has legs based on the information given. Therefore, it is uncertain whether KiKi is a dog or not. Since we cannot determine whether KiKi is a dog without knowing whether it barks, the statement is uncertain.\nANSWER:\tUncertain", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if KiKi neither barks nor is a dog. From the premises, we know that if an animal barks, then Jane does not like it, and all dogs are animals that bark. This means that if KiKi barks, then Jane does not like it. However, we don't know anything about whether KiKi is a dog or not, so we can't conclude yet if KiKi is a dog or not. Now, let's think about the other part of the conclusion, that KiKi neither barks. From the premises, we know that if an animal jumps, then Jane likes it, and if an animal has legs, then it jumps, and if an animal is terricolous, then it has legs. This means that if KiKi jumps, then it has legs, and if it has legs, then it is terricolous. However, we also know that if KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then it is terricolous or has legs. This means that if KiKi doesn't jump, it could be that it doesn't have legs, or it could be that it is terricolous and doesn't need legs to move. Therefore, it is uncertain if KiKi doesn't bark or is a dog.\n\nANSWER: Uncertain (for both parts of the conclusion)", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if KiKi neither barks nor is a dog. From the second premise, we know that all dogs bark. Therefore, if KiKi is a dog, it barks. But we are given that if an animal barks, then Jane does not like it. Since we don't know if Jane likes KiKi or not, it is uncertain if KiKi is a dog. Now, let's consider KiKi not being a dog. In this case, since KiKi neither barks nor is a dog, the statement is true.\n\nTo answer the conclusion, we don't need to evaluate whether KiKi jumps or has legs. Those pieces of information are not relevant to the question \"KiKi neither barks nor is a dog\".\n\nANSWER: True (given that KiKi is not a dog)\n\nHowever, if we want to evaluate the whole reasoning process, we should also consider that if KiKi is neither a dog nor jumps nor has legs, then it is terricolous. But the conclusion does not ask about the terricolousness of KiKi, so it is uncertain if that information is relevant or not.", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if KiKi neither barks nor is a dog. From the premises, we know that if an animal barks, then Jane does not like it, and all dogs are animals that bark. Therefore, if KiKi barks, then Jane does not like KiKi. Since we don't know whether KiKi is a dog, we can't say for certain that it doesn't bark.\n\nHowever, we also have other information about KiKi. We know that if an animal jumps, then Jane likes it. If an animal has legs, then it jumps, and if an animal is terricolous, then it has legs. If KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then it is either not terricolous or does not have legs. In this case, if KiKi does not have legs, it cannot jump, and Jane would not like it.\n\nSince we don't know whether KiKi barks and whether it is a dog, we can't definitively say that KiKi neither barks nor is a dog. However, we can say that if KiKi does not have legs, then it neither barks nor is a dog (because all dogs have legs and bark). So the statement is uncertain in general, but if we assume KiKi does not have legs, then the statement is true.\n\nANSWER:\tUncertain, but true if KiKi does not have legs.", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if KiKi neither barks nor is a dog. From the premises, we know that if an animal barks, then Jane does not like it and all dogs are animals that bark. Therefore, if KiKi barks, then Jane does not like it, which means Jane likes KiKi only if KiKi does not bark.\n\nNow, we know that if an animal jumps, then Jane likes it, and if an animal has legs, then it jumps and if it is terricolous, then it has legs. However, we also know that if KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then it is terricolous or has legs. This means that there are two possibilities for KiKi: either it doesn't jump and doesn't have legs, or it has legs and is terricolous but doesn't jump.\n\nIn the first possibility, since KiKi doesn't jump, Jane doesn't like it, and since we don't know if KiKi barks or not, we can't conclude that KiKi is not a dog or that it barks. In the second possibility, since KiKi has legs and is terricolous, it can jump, but the premises tell us that if it jumps, Jane likes it. This means that if KiKi is terricolous, it cannot both jump and have Jane not like it, which contradicts the premises.\n\nTherefore, the second possibility is not valid, and KiKi must not jump and doesn't have legs. Since dogs are animals that bark and KiKi doesn't jump, it is not a dog.
