However, based on the premises provided, we cannot conclude that "John flies to LGA airport." Here's why:

1. **Premise 1:** `FliesTo(Susan, LGA)` - This states that Susan flies to LGA.
2. **Premise 2:** `FliesFrom(x, y) & FliesTo(x, y) -> False` - This means that the departure and arrival cannot be at the same airport for the same person.
3. **Premise 3:** `FliesFrom(John, LGA)` - This states that John departs from LGA.

Given these premises, we know that John cannot fly from LGA and to LGA simultaneously because that would violate Premise 2. However, this does not provide any information about where John arrives. Therefore, the
