We also know that Ambiortus Dementjevi is the only known species of Ambiortus.\n\nGiven these facts, we can infer that Yevgeny Kurochkin discovered a specific bird genus (Ambiortus), but we cannot conclude that he discovered a new one because we don't have information about other bird genera existing before his discovery of Ambiortus.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"Yevgeny Kurochkin discovered a new bird genus\" does not necessarily follow from the given premises. To prove or disprove this, we would need additional information about other prehistoric bird genera existing prior to Yevgeny Kurochkin's discovery.\n\nIn first-order logic terms, we need to check if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. Let's use the provided predicates and translate the premises and conclusion as shown above, and then use a theorem solver like Prover9 to verify the logical entailment.\n\nHere\u2019s how the translated premises and conclusion look in FOL using the provided predicate/arity map:\n\nTEXT: Premises\nFOL: Prehistoric(BirdGenus(Ambiortus)) & \n     (all x. (KnownSpecies(Ambiortus, x) -> x = AmbiortusDementjevi)) &\n     (LivedIn(AmbiortusDementjevi, Mongolia)) &\n     (Discoverer(YevgenyKurochkin, BirdGenus(Ambiortus)))\n\nTEXT: Conclusion\nFOL: (Discoverer(YevgenyKurochkin, BirdGenus(X)) & -BirdGenus(X))\n\nUsing a theorem solver like Prover9, you can input these clauses to check if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. However, based on the given information, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises as stated.", "Predicate/arity map for the problem:\n['BirdGenus/1', 'Discoverer/2', 'KnownSpecies/2', 'LivedIn/2', 'Prehistoric/1']\n\nTEXT: Ambiortus is a prehistoric bird genus.\nFOL: Prehistoric(BirdGenus(Ambiortus))\n\nTEXT: Ambiortus Dementjevi is the only known species of Ambiortus.\nFOL: all x.

(Discoverer(YevgenyKurochkin, BirdGenus(x)) & -BirdGenus(x) = BirdGenus(Ambiortus))\n\nTo evaluate this, we need to ensure the premises and conclusion are correctly represented in first-order logic, and then use a theorem prover like Prover9 to check if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. Here\u2019s the complete FOL representation:\n\n```python\nfrom nltk.sem import Expression, Variable\n\n# Define predicates and constants\nBirdGenus = Expression('BirdGenus')\nPrehistoric = Expression('Prehistoric')\nDiscoverer = Expression('Discoverer')\nKnownSpecies = Expression('KnownSpecies')\nLivedIn = Expression('LivedIn')\n\n# Premises\npremise1 = Expression('all', Expression('x'), Expression('->', Prehistoric(BirdGenus(Expression('x'))), Expression('True')))\npremise2 = Expression('all', Expression('x'), Expression('->', KnownSpecies(Expression('x'), BirdGenus(Expression('Ambiortus'))), Expression('=')(Expression('x'), Expression('AmbiortusDementjevi'))))\npremise3 = Expression('LivedIn', Expression('AmbiortusDementjevi'), Expression('Mongolia'))\npremise4 = Expression('Discoverer', Expression('YevgenyKurochkin'), BirdGenus(Expression('Ambiortus')))\n\n# Conclusion\nconclusion = Expression('exists', Expression('x'), Expression('->', Expression('and', Expression('Discoverer')(Expression('YevgenyKurochkin'), BirdGenus(Expression('x'))), Expression('->')(Expression('not'), Expression('BirdGenus')(Expression('x')), Expression('=')(Expression('BirdGenus')(Expression('Ambiortus')), BirdGenus(Expression('x')))))))\n\n# Print the expressions\nprint(\"Premise 1:\", premise1)\nprint(\"Premise 2:\", premise2)\nprint(\"Premise 3:\", premise3)\nprint(\"Premise 4:\", premise4)\nprint(\"Conclusion:\", conclusion)\n```\n\nNow, you can use Prover9 or a similar tool to input these expressions and check if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. The conclusion is stated as an existential statement, asserting that there exists a bird genus discovered by Yevgeny Kurochkin other than Ambiortus. Given the premises, this conclusion does not necessarily follow because we know Yevgeny Kurochkin discovered Ambiortus, but there is no information suggesting he discovered any other bird genus. Therefore, the conclusion is likely not valid based on the given premises.", "Predicate/arity map for the problem:\n- `BirdGenus/1`: Represents a bird genus.\n- `Discoverer/2`: Represents the relationship between a person and the genus they discovered.\n- `KnownSpecies/2`: Represents the relationship between a genus and a known species.\n- `LivedIn/2`: Represents the relationship between a species and the place it lived.\n- `Prehistoric/1`: Represents whether a genus is prehistoric.\n\nLet's translate the premises and conclusion into FOL expressions:\n\n### PREMISES\n\n1. **Ambiortus is a prehistoric bird genus.**\n   FOL: `Prehistoric(BirdGenus(Ambiortus))`\n\n2. **Ambiortus Dementjevi is the only known species of Ambiortus.**\n   FOL: `all x.

The conclusion states that Pierre de Rigaud de Vaudreuil built a fort in New France. We know from the premises that he built Fort Carillon, and that Fort Carillon was located in New France.

Therefore, the conclusion `Built(PierreDeRigaudDeVaudreuil, FortX) & LocatedIn(FortX, NewFrance)` is valid with FortX being FortCarillon.\n\nThus, the conclusion \"Pierre de Rigaud de Vaudreuil built a fort in New France\" logically follows from the premises. \n\nTo confirm this using a theorem solver like Prover9, you would input the premises and the negation of the conclusion as a separate statement.

If Prover9 can derive the conclusion from the premises, then the conclusion follows; otherwise, it does not.\n\n### Expected Output\n\nIf Prover9 can derive the conclusion from the premises, the output will indicate that the conclusion is a logical consequence of the premises. If not, it will show that the conclusion does not follow from the premises.\n\nGiven the current premises and conclusion, since the premises state that all iPhones are electronic and there exist some phones that are iPhones, it logically follows that some phones are electronic. Therefore, the conclusion \"No phones are electronic\" does not follow from the premises.\n\nSo, the output from Prover9 should indicate that the conclusion does not follow from the premises.", "Let's translate the premises and the conclusion into First-Order Logic (FOL) expressions using the provided predicate/arity map:\n\n### Predicate/arity map:\n- `Electronic/1`\n- `Iphone/1`\n- `Phone/1`\n\n### Translations:\n\n#### Premises:\n1. **All iPhones are electronic.**\n   - `\u2200x (Iphone(x) \u2192 Electronic(x))`\n\n2. **Some phones are iPhones.**\n   - `\u2203x (Phone(x) \u2227 Iphone(x))`\n\n#### Conclusion:\n3. **No phones are electronic.**\n   - `\u2200x (Phone(x) \u2192 \u00acElectronic(x))`\n\n### FOL Expressions:\n\n```python\nfrom nltk import ProvClause\n\n# Define the predicates\nIphone = ProvClause('Iphone/1')\nElectronic = ProvClause('Electronic/1')\nPhone = ProvClause('Phone/1')\n\n# Translate the premises\npremise1 = \u2200x(Iphone(x) >> Electronic(x))\npremise2 = \u2203x(Phone(x) & Iphone(x))\n\n# Translate the conclusion\nconclusion = \u2200x(Phone(x) >> ~Electronic(x))\n```\n\n### Evaluation Using Prover9:\nTo determine whether the conclusion follows from the premises, we need to input these expressions into a theorem prover like Prover9.\n\nThe Prover9 input file would look something like this:\n\n```prolog\n% Define the predicates\nIphone(X) :- X is an iPhone.\nElectronic(X) :- X is electronic.\nPhone(X) :- X is a phone.\n\n% Premises\nall x (Iphone(x) -> Electronic(x)).\nexists x (Phone(x) & Iphone(x)).\n\n% Conclusion\nall x (Phone(x) -> ~Electronic(x)).\n```\n\n### Prover9 Commands:\nTo use Prover9, you would typically run the following commands:\n\n1. Write the above Prolog-like code to a file, say `example.p`.\n2. Run Prover9 with the command:\n   ```sh\n   prov9 example.p -t\n   ```\n\n### Expected Output:\nProver9 will attempt to prove the conclusion from the premises. If the conclusion follows logically from the premises, Prover9 will likely find a proof. Otherwise, it may return that the conclusion does not follow.\n\n### Analysis:\nGiven the premises:\n1. `\u2200x (Iphone(x) \u2192 Electronic(x))`: All iPhones are electronic.\n2. `\u2203x (Phone(x) \u2227 Iphone(x))`: There exists a phone that is an iPhone.\n\nThe conclusion:\n3. `\u2200x (Phone(x) \u2192 \u00acElectronic(x))`: No phones are electronic.\n\nThis conclusion directly contradicts the premises because if there is a phone that is also an iPhone, and all iPhones are electronic, then there must be a phone that is electronic. Therefore, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe conclusion \"No phones are electronic\" does not follow from the premises \"All iPhones are electronic\" and \"Some phones are iPhones.\"", "Let's translate the given premises and conclusion into First-Order Logic (FOL) expressions and evaluate whether the conclusion follows from the premises using the provided predicate/arity map.\n\n### Predicate/arity map for the problem:\n```python\n['Electronic/1', 'Iphone/1', 'Phone/1']\n```\n\n### Translating the Premises and Conclusion:\n\n#### Premises:\n1. **All iPhones are electronic.**\n   - `\u2200x (Iphone(x) \u2192 Electronic(x))`\n\n2. **Some phones are iPhones.**\n   - `\u2203x (Phone(x) \u2227 Iphone(x))`\n\n#### Conclusion:\n3. **No phones are electronic.**\n   - `\u2200x (Phone(x) \u2192 \u00acElectronic(x))`\n\n### FOL Expressions:\n\n```python\nfrom nltk import ProvClause\n\n# Define the predicates\nIphone = ProvClause('Iphone/1')\nElectronic = ProvClause('Electronic/1')\nPhone = ProvClause('Phone/1')\n\n# Translate the premises\npremise1 = \u2200x(Iphone(x) >> Electronic(x))\npremise2 = \u2203x(Phone(x) & Iphone(x))\n\n# Translate the conclusion\nconclusion = \u2200x(Phone(x) >> ~Electronic(x))\n```\n\n### Evaluation Using Prover9:\n\nTo determine whether the conclusion follows from the premises, we need to use a theorem prover like Prover9. However, since this is a text-based interface, we will provide the expressions directly and explain how you can input these into Prover9.\n\n#### Input for Prover9:\n\n1. **Input the premises:**\n   ```\n   all x (Iphone(x) -> Electronic(x)).\n   exists x (Phone(x) & Iphone(x)).\n   ```\n\n2. **Input the negation of the conclusion (to check for contradiction):**\n   ```\n   not (all x (Phone(x) -> ~Electronic(x))).\n   ```\n\nThis can be done by creating a file with these lines and running Prover9 on it.\n\n### Example File for Prover9:\n```prolog\n% Input file for Prover9\n\n% Premises\nall x (Iphone(x) -> Electronic(x)).\nexists x (Phone(x) & Iphone(x)).\n\n% Negation of the conclusion\nnot (all x (Phone(x) -> ~Electronic(x))).\n```\n\nSave this as `input_file.prf` and run Prover9 on it:\n\n```sh\nprover9 input_file.prf\n```\n\n### Expected Output:\nIf Prover9 finds a contradiction, it will indicate that the conclusion does not follow from the premises. Otherwise, if it fails to find a contradiction, it suggests that the conclusion may follow from the premises.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven the premises \"All iPhones are electronic\" and \"Some phones are iPhones,\" the conclusion \"No phones are electronic\" is contradictory because if there are phones that are iPhones (which are electronic), then there must be at least one phone that is electronic. Therefore, the conclusion \"No phones are electronic\" does not logically follow from the given premises.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n**The conclusion does not follow from the premises.**", "Let's translate the premises and the conclusion into first-order logic (FOL) expressions using the provided predicate/arity map:\n\n### Predicate/arity map for the problem:\n- `Electronic/1`\n- `Iphone/1`\n- `Phone/1`\n\n### Premises:\n1.

The premises state that some phones are iPhones and all iPhones are electronic, which means that there exists at least one phone that is electronic. Therefore, the conclusion \"No phones are electronic\" cannot logically follow from the premises.\n\n### Summary\n\nThe FOL expressions are correctly translated as follows:\n\n- Premise 1: \\( \\forall x (Iphone(x) \\rightarrow Electronic(x)) \\)\n- Premise 2: \\( \\exists x (Phone(x) \\land Iphone(x)) \\)\n- Conclusion: \\( \\forall x (Phone(x) \\rightarrow \\neg Electronic(x)) \\)\n\nGiven these translations, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.", "Let's translate the premises and the conclusion into FOL expressions using the provided predicate/arity map:\n\n### Predicate/arity map:\n- `Electronic/1`\n- `Iphone/1`\n- `Phone/1`\n\n### Translated Expressions:\n\n#### Premises:\n1. **All iPhones are electronic.**\n   - `\u2200x (Iphone(x) \u2192 Electronic(x))`\n\n2. **Some phones are iPhones.**\n   - `\u2203x (Phone(x) \u2227 Iphone(x))`\n\n#### Conclusion:\n3. **No phones are electronic.**\n   - `\u2200x (Phone(x) \u2192 \u00acElectronic(x))`\n\n### FOL Expressions:\n\n```python\nfrom nltk import ProvClause\n\n# Define the predicates\nIphone = ProvClause('Iphone/1')\nElectronic = ProvClause('Electronic/1')\nPhone = ProvClause('Phone/1')\n\n# Translate the premises\npremise1 = \u2200x(Iphone(x) >> Electronic(x))\npremise2 = \u2203x(Phone(x) & Iphone(x))\n\n# Translate the conclusion\nconclusion = \u2200x(Phone(x) >> ~Electronic(x))\n```\n\n### Evaluating the Problem with Prover9\n\nWe need to check if the conclusion follows from the premises.

Given the premises, Prover9 should be able to show that the conclusion does not follow because the premises imply that iPhones are electronic, and since some phones are iPhones, at least one phone must be electronic, contradicting the conclusion.\n\n### Output Interpretation:\nProver9 will likely output a refutation indicating that the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises. This is consistent with our reasoning since the premises and the conclusion are contradictory.\n\nBy translating and evaluating the logical statements in this manner, we can verify the validity of the argument.", "Let's translate the premises and the conclusion into First-Order Logic (FOL) expressions using the provided predicate/arity map:\n\n### Predicate/arity map for the problem:\n- `Electronic/1`\n- `Iphone/1`\n- `Phone/1`\n\n### Translating the Premises and Conclusion\n\n#### Premises:\n1. **All iPhones are electronic.**\n   - FOL: `\u2200x (Iphone(x) \u2192 Electronic(x))`\n\n2. **Some phones are iPhones.**\n   - FOL: `\u2203x (Phone(x) \u2227 Iphone(x))`\n\n#### Conclusion:\n3. **No phones are electronic.**\n   - FOL: `\u2200x (Phone(x) \u2192 \u00acElectronic(x))`\n\n### FOL Expressions:\n\n```python\nfrom nltk import ProvClause\n\n# Define the predicates\nIphone = ProvClause('Iphone/1')\nElectronic = ProvClause('Electronic/1')\nPhone = ProvClause('Phone/1')\n\n# Translate the premises\npremise1 = \u2200x(Iphone(x) >> Electronic(x))\npremise2 = \u2203x(Phone(x) & Iphone(x))\n\n# Translate the conclusion\nconclusion = \u2200x(Phone(x) >> ~Electronic(x))\n```\n\n### Evaluation using a Theorem Solver like Prover9\n\nWe need to input these expressions into a theorem solver like Prover9 to determine if the conclusion follows from the premises.

It's a Holi-Holiday!\" was a big hit all over Europe.**\n   - This indicates that the song was successful but doesn't specify its chart performance in Germany.\n\n3. **\"Hooray! Hooray! It's a Holi-Holiday!\" was not in German #1 singles.**\n   - This tells us that the song did not achieve the top spot on the German charts.\n\n4. **A song that peaks below #1 on the german charts is also a song that is not the #1 single in Germany.**\n   - This provides a conditional statement relating peak positions and being a #1 single.\n\n5. **\"Hooray! Hooray! It's a Holi-Holiday!\" peaked below #1 on the German charts.**\n   - This is what we aim to prove.\n\nFrom the premises, we can use the fourth statement to derive the fifth one. Since the song is not in German #1 singles (from the third statement), and we know that if a song peaks below #1, it is not the #1 single, we can conclude that \"Hooray! Hooray! It's a Holi-Holiday!\" peaked below #1 on the German charts.\n\nFormulating this in FOL:\n\n```python\n# Premises\nall x.

It's a Holi-Holiday!\")\npremise3 = Not(Single(\"Hooray! Hooray! It's a Holi-Holiday!\")) & Not(GermanCharts(\"Hooray! Hooray! It's a Holi-Holiday!\")) & Not(#1Singles(\"Hooray! Hooray! It's a Holi-Holiday!\"))\npremise4 = Forall('x', Implies(PeaksBelow1('x'), Not(#1Singles('x'))))\n\n# Conclusion\nconclusion = PeaksBelow1(\"Hooray! Hooray! It's a Holi-Holiday!\")\n\n# Combine all premises and the conclusion\npropositions = [premise1, premise2, premise3, premise4, Not(conclusion)]\n\n# Print the propositions\nfor prop in propositions:\n    print(prop)\n```\n\nWhen running this through Prover9, we need to ensure the problem is correctly set up for automated theorem proving. Given the complexity, we can use the following input format for Prover9:\n\n```\nformulas(assumptions).\nall x. (Single(x) & GermanCharts(x) & #1Singles(x)).\nHit(\"Hooray! Hooray! It's a Holi-Holiday!\").\n-not Single(\"Hooray! Hooray! It's a Holi-Holiday!\") & -GermanCharts(\"Hooray! Hooray! It's a Holi-Holiday!\") & -#1Singles(\"Hooray! Hooray! It's a Holi-Holiday!\").\nall x. (PeaksBelow1(x) -> -#1Singles(x)).\n\nend_of_list.\n\nformulas(goals).\nnot PeaksBelow1(\"Hooray! Hooray! It's a Holi-Holiday!\").\n\nend_of_list.\n```\n\nRunning this through Prover9 will attempt to derive the negation of the conclusion from the premises, and if it fails, it confirms that the conclusion logically follows from the premises. Given the logical structure and the provided premises, the conclusion `PeaksBelow1(\"Hooray! Hooray! It's a Holi-Holiday!\")` should follow from the premises, as it is consistent with the information given and aligns with the rules provided.", "Predicate/arity map for the problem:\n['GermanCharts/1', 'Hit/1', 'PeaksBelow1/1', 'Single/1']\n\nTEXT: Boney M. had several German #1 singles.\nFOL: all x.

Here is the evaluation:\n\n```python\nfrom nltk import wff\n\n# Premises\npremise1 = wff.Formula(wff.Forall('x', wff.Implication(wff.Predicate('Single', 'x'), wff.Predicate('GermanCharts', 'x'))))\npremise2 = wff.Formula(wff.Predicate('Hit', 'Hooray!

The next step would be to input these formulas into Prover9 to check if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.", "Predicate/arity map for the problem:\n['GermanCharts/1', 'Hit/1', 'PeaksBelow1/1', 'Single/1']\n\nTEXT: Boney M. had several German #1 singles.\nFOL: all x.

(Single(x) & GermanCharts(x) & Hit(x) -> #1(x))` (All German #1 singles are big hits.)\n   - `Hit(\"Hooray! Hooray! It's a Holi-Holiday!\")` (\"Hooray! Hooray! It's a Holi-Holiday!\" was a big hit all over Europe.)\n   - `-exists x. (Single(x) & GermanCharts(x) & Hit(\"Hooray! Hooray! It's a Holi-Holiday!\") & #1(x))` (\"Hooray! Hooray! It's a Holi-Holiday!\" was not in German #1 singles.)\n   - `all x. (Single(x) & GermanCharts(x) & PeaksBelow1(x) -> -#1(x))` (All songs that peak below #1 on the German charts are not #1 singles.)\n\n2. **Conclusion:**\n   - `PeaksBelow1(\"Hooray! Hooray! It's a Holi-Holiday!\")` (We need to prove that \"Hooray! Hooray! It's a Holi-Holiday!\" peaked below #1 on the German charts.)\n\n3. **Evaluation using a theorem solver:**\n\nGiven the premises, let's see if we can derive the conclusion:\n\n- From premise 1, we know that \"Hooray! Hooray! It's a Holi-Holiday!\" being a big hit does not imply it is a German #1 single because of premise 2.\n- Premise 3 confirms that \"Hooray! Hooray! It's a Holi-Holiday!\" was not in German #1 singles.\n- Using premise 4, if a song is not a #1 single, it could still be a song that peaks below #1 on the German charts.\n\nSince \"Hooray! Hooray! It's a Holi-Holiday!\" is a big hit but not a German #1 single (from premise 2 and 3), it must be a song that peaks below #1 on the German charts according to premise 4.\n\nThus, the conclusion `PeaksBelow1(\"Hooray! Hooray! It's a Holi-Holiday!\")` logically follows from the given premises.\n\n**Final FOL Expressions:**\n```python\nfrom nltk import *\nfrom nltk.sem import logic\n\n# Predicate/arity map\npredicates = ['GermanCharts/1', 'Hit/1', 'PeaksBelow1/1', 'Single/1']\n\n# Premises\npremise1 = Forall('x', (And(Single('x'), GermanCharts('x'), Hit('x')) >> #1('x')))\npremise2 = Hit(\"Hooray!

From the second premise, we know that if an assessment is an international test, ETS administers it.\n2. From the third premise, we know that ETS develops assessments related to tertiary and quaternary education, which are part of the international context.\n3. Therefore, it is possible that some of the assessments developed by ETS for these higher education institutions could be international tests.\n\nGiven these points, the conclusion that \"ETS doesn't administer tests internationally\" does not logically follow from the premises because there is no explicit statement that ETS does not administer any international tests.

From premise 1, we know `DrainageBasinOf(CrotonRiverWatershed, CrotonRiver)`.\n2. From premise 3, we know `FlowsTo(WaterFromCrotonRiverWatershed, Bronx)`.\n3. From premise 2, we know `InLocation(Bronx, NewYork)`.\n4. Therefore, `FlowsTo(WaterFromCrotonRiverWatershed, Bronx)` implies `FlowsTo(WaterFromCrotonRiverWatershed, ?x)` where `?x` is in `NewYork`.\n\nThus, the conclusion `Water from the Croton River watershed flows to somewhere in New York` is logically valid based on the premises.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion follows from the premises.", "Predicate/arity map for the problem:\n['DrainageBasinOf/2', 'InLocation/2', 'FlowsTo/2']\n\nTEXT: The Croton River watershed is the drainage basin of the Croton River.\nFOL: DrainageBasinOf(CrotonRiverWatershed, CrotonRiver)\n\nTEXT: The Croton River is in southwestern New York.\nFOL: InLocation(CrotonRiver, NewYork)\n\nTEXT: Water from the Croton River watershed flows to the Bronx.\nFOL: FlowsTo(WaterFrom(CrotonRiverWatershed), Bronx)\n\nTEXT: The Bronx is in New York.\nFOL: InLocation(Bronx, NewYork)\n\nTEXT: Water from the Croton River watershed flows to somewhere in New York.\nFOL: FlowsTo(WaterFrom(CrotonRiverWatershed), SomePlaceInNewYork)\n\nIn this context, `SomePlaceInNewYork` can be represented as a variable, say `X`, where `X` is such that `InLocation(X, NewYork)` holds true. Thus, we can express the conclusion as:\n\nTEXT: Water from the Croton River watershed flows to somewhere in New York.\nFOL: exists x. (FlowsTo(WaterFrom(CrotonRiverWatershed), x) & InLocation(x, NewYork))\n\nThis FOL expression captures the essence of the conclusion that water from the Croton River watershed flows to some place within New York.

(InLocation(x, NewYork) & FlowsTo(WaterFrom(CrotonRiverWatershed), x))\n```", "Predicate/arity map for the problem:\n['DrainageBasinOf/2', 'InLocation/2', 'FlowsTo/2']\n\nTEXT: The Croton River watershed is the drainage basin of the Croton River.\nFOL: DrainageBasinOf(CrotonRiverWatershed, CrotonRiver)\n\nTEXT: The Croton River is in southwestern New York.\nFOL: InLocation(CrotonRiver, NewYork)\n\nTEXT: Water from the Croton River watershed flows to the Bronx.\nFOL: FlowsTo(WaterFromCrotonRiverWatershed, Bronx)\n\nTEXT: The Bronx is in New York.\nFOL: InLocation(Bronx, NewYork)\n\nTEXT: Water from the Croton River watershed flows to somewhere in New York.\nFOL: FlowsTo(WaterFromCrotonRiverWatershed, SomePartOfNewYork)\n\nLet's break down the translations step-by-step:\n\n1. **Translation of Premises:**\n\n   - The Croton River watershed is the drainage basin of the Croton River.\n     ```python\n     DrainageBasinOf(CrotonRiverWatershed, CrotonRiver)\n     ```\n\n   - The Croton River is in southwestern New York.\n     ```python\n     InLocation(CrotonRiver, NewYork)\n     ```\n\n   - Water from the Croton River watershed flows to the Bronx.\n     ```python\n     FlowsTo(WaterFromCrotonRiverWatershed, Bronx)\n     ```\n\n   - The Bronx is in New York.\n     ```python\n     InLocation(Bronx, NewYork)\n     ```\n\n2. **Translation of Conclusion:**\n\n   - Water from the Croton River watershed flows to somewhere in New York.\n     ```python\n     FlowsTo(WaterFromCrotonRiverWatershed, SomePartOfNewYork)\n     ```\n\nNow, we need to evaluate whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises. We will use the provided predicate/arity map and express the sentences in the format required by the Python NLTK package logic module.\n\nHere are the final FOL expressions:\n\n```python\n# Premises\nall x. all y. (DrainageBasinOf(x, y) -> DrainageBasinOf(CrotonRiverWatershed, CrotonRiver))\nall x. all y. (InLocation(x, y) -> InLocation(CrotonRiver, NewYork))\nall x. all y.

(InLocation(x, y) -> InLocation(Bronx, NewYork))\n\n# Conclusion\nFlowsTo(WaterFromCrotonRiverWatershed, SomePartOfNewYork)\n```\n\nSince the Bronx is in New York and water from the Croton River watershed flows to the Bronx, it follows that water from the Croton River watershed flows to some part of New York. Therefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\n```python\n# Translated Conclusion\nFlowsTo(WaterFromCrotonRiverWatershed, SomePartOfNewYork)\n```\n\nThus, the conclusion \"Water from the Croton River watershed flows to somewhere in New York\" is valid based on the given premises.", "Predicate/arity map for the problem:\n['DrainageBasinOf/2', 'InLocation/2', 'FlowsTo/2']\n\nTEXT: The Croton River watershed is the drainage basin of the Croton River.\nFOL: DrainageBasinOf(CrotonRiverWatershed, CrotonRiver)\n\nTEXT: The Croton River is in southwestern New York.\nFOL: InLocation(CrotonRiver, NewYork)\n\nTEXT: Water from the Croton River watershed flows to the Bronx.\nFOL: FlowsTo(WaterFrom(CrotonRiverWatershed), Bronx)\n\nTEXT: The Bronx is in New York.\nFOL: InLocation(Bronx, NewYork)\n\nTEXT: Water from the Croton River watershed flows to somewhere in New York.\nFOL: Exists x. (InLocation(x, NewYork) & FlowsTo(WaterFrom(CrotonRiverWatershed), x))\n\nNow, we need to translate the premises and the conclusion into the format used by the Python NLTK package logic module:\n\n```python\nfrom nltk import wnf\n\n# Premises\npremise1 = wnf.parse(\"all x. all y.

(DrainageBasinOf(x, y) -> all z. (z == CrotonRiver -> z == y))`. This ensures that the Croton River watershed is indeed the drainage basin of the Croton River.\n2. **Premise 2**: `InLocation(CrotonRiver, NewYork)` translates to `all x. (x == CrotonRiver -> InLocation(x, NewYork))`.\n3. **Premise 3**: `FlowsTo(WaterFrom(CrotonRiverWatershed), Bronx)` is already in a suitable form.\n4. **Premise 4**: `InLocation(Bronx, NewYork)` translates to `all x. (x == Bronx -> InLocation(x, NewYork))`.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: `Exists x. (InLocation(x, NewYork) & FlowsTo(WaterFrom(CrotonRiverWatershed), x))` ensures that there exists some location in New York where water from the Croton River watershed flows to.\n\nThese FOL expressions can now be input into a theorem prover like Prover9 to determine if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.", "Predicate/arity map for the problem:\n['DrainageBasinOf/2', 'InLocation/2', 'FlowsTo/2']\n\nTEXT: The Croton River watershed is the drainage basin of the Croton River.\nFOL: DrainageBasinOf(CrotonRiverWatershed, CrotonRiver)\n\nTEXT: The Croton River is in southwestern New York.\nFOL: InLocation(CrotonRiver, NewYork)\n\nTEXT: Water from the Croton River watershed flows to the Bronx.\nFOL: FlowsTo(WaterFrom(CrotonRiverWatershed), Bronx)\n\nTEXT: The Bronx is in New York.\nFOL: InLocation(Bronx, NewYork)\n\nTEXT: Water from the Croton River watershed flows to somewhere in New York.\nFOL: FlowsTo(WaterFrom(CrotonRiverWatershed), SomePlaceInNewYork)\n\nWhere `SomePlaceInNewYork` is a placeholder representing \"somewhere in New York\". To express that there exists some place in New York where water from the Croton River watershed flows, we can use existential quantification:\n\nFOL: FlowsTo(WaterFrom(CrotonRiverWatershed), SomePlaceInNewYork) is translated to:\nFOL: Exists x. (InLocation(x, NewYork) & FlowsTo(WaterFrom(CrotonRiverWatershed), x))\n\nThis translates the statement \"Water from the Croton River watershed flows to somewhere in New York\" into a first-order logic expression. Now we can evaluate this using a theorem prover like Prover9.\n\nThe final set of FOL expressions is as follows:\n\n```\n# Premises\nall x. all y.

(ImportantScientificAchievement(x) -> UsInvention(x))`\n\n### Evaluation:\nNow, we have the following FOL expressions:\n\n- Premise 1: `all x. (ArtificialSatellite(x) -> ImportantScientificAchievement(x))`\n- Premise 2: `exists x. (ArtificialSatellite(x) & -UsInvention(x))`\n- Conclusion: `all x. (ImportantScientificAchievement(x) -> UsInvention(x))`\n\nWe need to check whether the conclusion follows from the premises. Let's analyze this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Premise 1**: States that every artificial satellite is an important scientific achievement.\n2. **Premise 2**: States that there exists at least one artificial satellite that is not a U.S. invention.\n3. **Conclusion**: Claims that every important scientific achievement must be a U.S. invention.\n\nTo see if the conclusion follows from the premises, consider the following:\n\n- From Premise 1, if something is an artificial satellite, it is also an important scientific achievement.\n- From Premise 2, we know there is at least one artificial satellite that is not a U.S. invention. This means there is at least one important scientific achievement that is not a U.S. invention.\n\nHowever, the conclusion states that all important scientific achievements are U.S. inventions. This directly contradicts Premise 2 because if there is an important scientific achievement that is not a U.S. invention (as stated in Premise 2), then not all important scientific achievements can be U.S. inventions.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe conclusion \"All important scientific achievements are U.S. inventions\" does not follow from the premises.", "Let's evaluate the given premises and conclusion using first-order logic (FOL) expressions. We will use the provided predicate/arity map:\n\nPredicate/arity map for the problem:\n- `ImportantScientificAchievement/1`\n- `ArtificialSatellite/1`\n- `UsInvention/1`\n\nNow, let's translate each of the premises and the conclusion into FOL expressions.\n\n### Premises:\n1. **All artificial satellites are important scientific achievements.**\n   FOL: \\( \\forall x \\, (\\text{ArtificialSatellite}(x) \\rightarrow \\text{ImportantScientificAchievement}(x)) \\)\n\n2. **Some artificial satellites are not U.S. inventions.**\n   FOL: \\( \\exists x \\, (\\text{ArtificialSatellite}(x) \\land \\neg \\text{UsInvention}(x)) \\)\n\n### Conclusion:\n3. **All important scientific achievements are U.S. inventions.**\n   FOL: \\( \\forall x \\, (\\text{ImportantScientificAchievement}(x) \\rightarrow \\text{UsInvention}(x)) \\)\n\n### Evaluation:\nWe need to determine if the conclusion follows from the premises using a theorem solver like Prover9. Let's input the FOL expressions into Prover9 and see if the conclusion can be derived from the premises.\n\n#### Input for Prover9:\n```prolog\n% Predicate/arity map\nImportantScientificAchievement(X) :- !.\nArtificialSatellite(X) :- !.\nUsInvention(X) :- !\n\n% Premises\nall_x(artificial_satellite(X) -> important_scientific_achievement(X)).\nexists_x(artificial_satellite(X) & ~us_invention(X)).\n\n% Conclusion\nall_x(important_scientific_achievement(X) -> us_invention(X)).\n```\n\nWhen we input these expressions into Prover9, we need to use the correct syntax for Prover9. Here is how you can format it for Prover9:\n\n```prolog\n% Predicate definitions\npredicate(important_scientific_achievement/1).\npredicate/artificial_satellite/1.\npredicate/us_invention/1.\n\n% Premises\nall_x(artificial_satellite(X), important_scientific_achievement(X)).\nexists_x(artificial_satellite(X), not(us_invention(X))).\n\n% Conclusion\nall_x(important_scientific_achievement(X), us_invention(X)).\n```\n\nAfter inputting this into Prover9 and running the solver, we can check if the conclusion is derivable from the premises.\n\n### Result:\nRunning the above input through Prover9 would show that the conclusion does not follow from the premises. The premises state that all artificial satellites are important scientific achievements and that some artificial satellites are not U.S. inventions, but they do not provide enough information to conclude that all important scientific achievements are U.S. inventions. Therefore, the conclusion is not logically valid based on the given premises.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{The conclusion does not follow from the premises.}}\n\\]", "Predicate/arity map for the problem:\n['ArtificialSatellite/1', 'ImportantScientificAchievement/1', 'UsInvention/1']\n\nTEXT: All artificial satellites are important scientific achievements.\nFOL: all x.

However, based on the logical structure of the problem:\n\n1. From **Premise 1**, we know that every artificial satellite is an important scientific achievement.\n2. From **Premise 2**, there exists at least one artificial satellite that is not a U.S. invention.\n\nGiven these premises, we cannot logically conclude that **all important scientific achievements are U.S. inventions**.

From premise 1, we know that if something is a Heptalogy, it must consist of seven distinct works. However, premise 3 tells us that \"The Chronicles of Narnia\" also consists of seven distinct works. Therefore, based on premise 1, \"The Chronicles of Narnia\" could be a Heptalogy. But premise 4 directly states that \"The Chronicles of Narnia\" is not a Heptalogy. This is a contradiction because if it consisted of seven distinct works (premise 3), it could still be a Heptalogy. \n\nTherefore, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises because it contradicts the possibility that \"The Chronicles of Narnia\" could be a Heptalogy. \n\nTo summarize, the conclusion \"The Chronicles of Narnia series of books is not Heptalogy\" does not follow from the premises.", "Predicate/arity map for the problem:\n- `Heptalogy/1`: Represents works that are Heptalogies.\n- `ConsistsOfSevenWorks/1`: Represents works that consist of seven distinct works.\n\nLet's translate each premise and the conclusion into first-order logic (FOL) expressions:\n\n**Premises:**\n1. **Heptalogyy is a compound literary or narrative work that is made up of seven distinct works.**\n   FOL: `all x.

However, they did not score the same number of goals in both periods, so this does not apply either.\n\nSince neither condition for needing a penalty shoot-out is satisfied based on the given information, the conclusion that \"Real Madrid and Atl\u00e9tico Madrid did not need to play a penalty shoot-out in the 2016 UCL final\" logically follows from the premises.\n\nFOL for the conclusion:\nFOL: -PenaltyShootOut(RealMadrid, 2016) & -PenaltyShootOut(Atl\u00e9ticoMadrid, 2016)\n\nThis translation allows the expressions to be evaluated by a theorem solver like Prover9.", "Predicate/arity map for the problem: \n['Goal/2', 'PenaltyShootOut/2', 'RegularTime/1', 'ScoreSameGoalsRegularTime/2', 'ScoreSameGoalsBothRegularAndExtraTime/2', 'UCLFinal/1']\n\nTEXT: If two soccer teams score the same number of goals in one UCL final during the regular time, they need to play for the extra time.\nFOL: all x all y.

Here's why:\n\n1. From the premise \"When something is depressing, it is sad,\" we know that if anything (including the end of a relationship) is depressing, then it is sad.\n2. The second premise states that \"The end of a relationship is depressing.\" Combining these two premises, we can conclude that \"The end of a relationship is sad.\"\n3. The conclusion \"The end of a relationship is invigorating\" directly contradicts the conclusion we can derive from the premises, which is that the end of a relationship is sad.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"The end of a relationship is invigorating\" does not follow from the given premises.\n\nTo confirm this using a theorem solver like Prover9, you would input the premises and the negated conclusion as follows:\n\n```python\nfrom nltk.sem import LogicForm\nfrom nltk.parse import DependencyGraph\n\n# Define the predicates and their arity\npredicates = {'Depressing': 1, 'Sad': 1, 'EndOfRelationship': 0, 'Invigorating': 1}\n\n# Premises\npremise1 = LogicForm(lambda x: predicates['Depressing'](x) >> predicates['Sad'](x)).predicate('Depressing(x) >> Sad(x)')\npremise2 = LogicForm(predicates['Depressing'](predicates['EndOfRelationship']())).predicate('Depressing(EndOfRelationship)')\n\n# Negated conclusion\nnegated_conclusion = LogicForm(lambda x: ~predicates['Invigorating'](x)).predicate('~Invigorating(EndOfRelationship)')\n\n# Input for Prover9\nprover9_input = f\"\"\"\nfof(p1, axiom, {str(premise1)}).\nfof(p2, axiom, {str(premise2)}).\nfof(c, conjecture, {str(negated_conclusion)}).\n\"\"\"\n\nprint(prover9_input)\n```\n\nRunning Prover9 with this input will likely result in a refutation, indicating that the negated conclusion cannot be derived from the premises, thus confirming our reasoning.", "Predicate/arity map for the problem: \n['Depressing/1', 'Sad/1', 'EndOfRelationship/0']\n\nTEXT: When something is depressing, it is sad.\nFOL: all x.

Since the premises establish that the end of a relationship is depressing and therefore sad, but the conclusion states that the end of a relationship is invigorating (which is a contradiction), Prover9 should be able to demonstrate that the conclusion does not follow from the premises.\n\n### Expected Output\n\nProver9 should output that the goal `not invigorating(EndOfRelationship)` is indeed unsatisfiable, indicating that the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.", "Let's translate the premises and the conclusion into first-order logic (FOL) expressions using the provided predicate/arity map:\n\nPredicate/arity map for the problem:\n- `Depressing/1`\n- `Sad/1`\n- `EndOfRelationship/0`\n\nTEXT: When something is depressing, it is sad.\nFOL: all x.

However, the premises only provide information about the relationship between being depressing and being sad, and they tell us that the end of a relationship is depressing.

Therefore, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.\n\nTo evaluate this formally using Prover9, you would input the premises and the negation of the conclusion into Prover9 and see if it can derive a contradiction:\n\n```prolog\n% Input the premises\n(brics china).\n(economy_emerging china).\n(all x. (from_country(x china) -> chinese_person(x))).\n(brics india).\n(economy_emerging india).\n(all x. (from_country(x india) -> indian_person(x))).\n(exists x. (from_country(x india))).\n\n% Negate the conclusion and input it\n(not economy_emerging india).\n\n% Run Prover9 to check for contradiction\n% If Prover9 can derive a contradiction, the conclusion follows.\n```\n\nProver9 will analyze the logical structure and determine whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In this case, since the premises directly state that India has an emerging economy, the conclusion that India's economy is not emerging cannot be true.

Based on the provided information, since Richard Hamming is known to have worked in numerical methods and he is one of the Turing Award winners, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.

Here\u2019s a simplified way to do this using the `prover9` tool:\n\n1. Save the premises and conclusion in a file (e.g., `problem.fol`):\n\n```prolog\n% Premises\nall x. (IsRapper(x) -> exists y. (RapAlbum(y) & ReleasedAlbum(x, y)))\nIsRapper(Tyga)\nReleasedAlbum(Tyga, 'Well Done 3')\nall x. (IsRapper(x) -> -IsOperaSinger(x))\n\n% Conclusion\nRapAlbum('Well Done 3')\n```\n\n2. Run Prover9 with this input file to check the validity:\n\n```bash\nprover9 problem.fol\n```\n\nProver9 will attempt to prove the conclusion from the premises. If it finds a proof, it means the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nIn this case, Prover9 should find a proof since the logic aligns with the given information.", "Let's translate the premises and the conclusion into first-order logic (FOL) expressions using the provided predicate/arity map and then evaluate whether the conclusion follows from the premises.\n\nPredicate/arity map for the problem:\n- `IsRapper/1`\n- `IsOperaSinger/1`\n- `ReleasedAlbum/2`\n- `RapAlbum/1`\n\nThe translated FOL expressions would be as follows:\n\n```python\nfrom nltk import Expression\n\n# Define predicates\nIsRapper = Expression('IsRapper', 1)\nIsOperaSinger = Expression('IsOperaSinger', 1)\nReleasedAlbum = Expression('ReleasedAlbum', 2)\nRapAlbum = Expression('RapAlbum', 1)\n\n# Premises\npremises = [\n    IsRapper('Tyga'),  # Tyga is a rapper\n    IsRapper.arity(1).implies(RapAlbum.arity(1)),  # All rappers release rap albums\n    ReleasedAlbum('Tyga', 'Well Done 3'),  # Tyga released the Well Done 3 album\n    IsRapper.arity(1).implies(~IsOperaSinger.arity(1))  # Rappers are not opera singers\n]\n\n# Conclusion\nconclusion = RapAlbum('Well Done 3')  # Well Done 3 is a rap album\n```\n\nNow, we need to evaluate whether the conclusion follows from the premises using a theorem prover like Prover9. Here is how you can structure the input for Prover9:\n\n### Input for Prover9\n\n1. **Define Predicates:**\n   ```prolog\n   predicate_list([\n       is_rapper(_),\n       is_opera_singer(_),\n       released_album(_, _),\n       rap_album(_)\n   ]).\n   ```\n\n2. **Premises:**\n   ```prolog\n   clause(is_rapper(tyga)).\n   clause(all(X, is_rapper(X) -> rap_album(X))).\n   clause(released_album(tyga, well_done_3)).\n   clause(all(X, is_rapper(X) -> not is_opera_singer(X))).\n   ```\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   ```prolog\n   goal(rap_album(well_done_3)).\n   ```\n\n### Running Prover9\n\nYou would typically run Prover9 with this input file to check if the conclusion follows from the premises. Here is an example of how you might set up the input file and run Prover9:\n\n#### Input File (`input.txt`):\n```prolog\n% Define Predicates\npredicate_list([\n    is_rapper(_),\n    is_opera_singer(_),\n    released_album(_, _),\n    rap_album(_)\n]).\n\n% Premises\nclause(is_rapper(tyga)).\nclause(all(X, is_rapper(X) -> rap_album(X))).\nclause(released_album(tyga, well_done_3)).\nclause(all(X, is_rapper(X) -> not is_opera_singer(X))).\n\n% Conclusion\ngoal(rap_album(well_done_3)).\n```\n\n#### Running Prover9:\nSave the above content into a file named `input.txt`. Then, you can run Prover9 as follows:\n\n```sh\nprover9 < input.txt\n```\n\nProver9 will attempt to prove the goal based on the premises. If it can derive the conclusion, it will output a proof; otherwise, it will indicate that the conclusion does not follow from the premises.\n\n### Analysis\n\nGiven the premises:\n1. Tyga is a rapper.\n2. All rappers release rap albums.\n3. Tyga released the Well Done 3 album.\n4. Rappers are not opera singers.\n\nWe need to show:\n- Well Done 3 is a rap album.\n\nFrom premise 1 and 2, since Tyga is a rapper, it follows that Tyga releases a rap album (by premise 2). From premise 3, we know that Tyga indeed released the Well Done 3 album. Therefore, by combining these premises, we can conclude that Well Done 3 is a rap album.\n\nThus, the conclusion logically follows from the premises.", "Let's translate the premises and the conclusion into first-order logic (FOL) expressions using the provided predicate/arity map:\n\n### Predicate/arity map for the problem:\n```python\n['IsRapper/1', 'IsOperaSinger/1', 'ReleasedAlbum/2', 'RapAlbum/1']\n```\n\n### Translated FOL expressions:\n\n#### Premises:\n1. **Tyga is a rapper.**\n   ```python\n   IsRapper('Tyga')\n   ```\n\n2. **Rappers release rap albums.**\n   ```python\n   all x.

(IsRapper(x) -> -IsOperaSinger(x))\n   ```\n\n#### Conclusion:\n5. **Well Done 3 is a rap album.**\n   ```python\n   RapAlbum('Well Done 3')\n   ```\n\n### Full set of FOL expressions in Python using the `Expression` class from the NLTK package:\n\n```python\nfrom nltk import Expression\n\n# Define predicates\nIsRapper = Expression('IsRapper', 1)\nIsOperaSinger = Expression('IsOperaSinger', 1)\nReleasedAlbum = Expression('ReleasedAlbum', 2)\nRapAlbum = Expression('RapAlbum', 1)\n\n# Premises\npremises = [\n    IsRapper('Tyga'),  # Tyga is a rapper\n    all(x).implies(IsRapper(x), RapAlbum(x)),  # Rappers release rap albums\n    ReleasedAlbum('Tyga', 'Well Done 3'),  # Tyga released the Well Done 3 album\n    all(x).implies(IsRapper(x), -IsOperaSinger(x))  # Rappers are not opera singers\n]\n\n# Conclusion\nconclusion = RapAlbum('Well Done 3')  # Well Done 3 is a rap album\n```\n\n### Note on `all(x).implies(...)`: \nIn the above code, I used `all(x).implies(...)` to represent the universal quantifier `all x. (P(x) -> Q(x))`. The `all(x).implies(IsRapper(x), RapAlbum(x))` is a shorthand for saying \"for all `x`, if `x` is a rapper, then `x` releases a rap album.\"\n\nThis setup can be fed into a theorem prover like Prover9 to check if the conclusion follows from the premises.\n\n### Evaluation using Prover9:\nYou would input the above FOL expressions into Prover9 and run the proof procedure to determine if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.", "Predicate/arity map for the problem:\n- `IsRapper/1`\n- `IsOperaSinger/1`\n- `ReleasedAlbum/2`\n- `RapAlbum/1`\n\nFOL expressions based on the provided premises and conclusion:\n\n```python\nfrom nltk import Expression\n\n# Define predicates\nIsRapper = Expression('IsRapper', 1)\nIsOperaSinger = Expression('IsOperaSinger', 1)\nReleasedAlbum = Expression('ReleasedAlbum', 2)\nRapAlbum = Expression('RapAlbum', 1)\n\n# Premises\npremises = [\n    IsRapper('Tyga'),  # Tyga is a rapper\n    IsRapper.arity(1).implies(RapAlbum.arity(1)),  # All rappers release rap albums\n    ReleasedAlbum('Tyga', 'Well Done 3'),  # Tyga released the Well Done 3 album\n    IsRapper.arity(1).implies(~IsOperaSinger.arity(1)),  # Rappers are not opera singers\n]\n\n# Conclusion\nconclusion = RapAlbum('Well Done 3')  # Well Done 3 is a rap album\n```\n\nTo evaluate whether the conclusion follows from the premises, we need to use a theorem prover like Prover9. The above FOL expressions represent the logical statements given in the problem. To proceed with evaluating this, you would typically convert these expressions into a format suitable for Prover9 and run the proof.\n\nHere's how the expressions might look in a Prover9 input file:\n\n```plaintext\n% Premises\nall X.

Given the premises, we know that:\n1. Tyga is a rapper.\n2. All rappers release rap albums.\n3. Tyga released the Well Done 3 album.\n\nFrom these premises, we can infer that since Tyga is a rapper and all rappers release rap albums, the Well Done 3 album must be a rap album.\n\nThus, the conclusion `RapAlbum('Well Done 3')` logically follows from the premises.\n\n### Evaluation with Prover9:\nTo evaluate this with Prover9, you can use the following input format:\n\n```plaintext\nformulas(assumptions).\n  IsRapper(Tyga).\n  all x.

(Fear(x) & Terror(x))\nNote: To express \"no fears lead to terror,\" we need to negate the existence of such a fear. This translates to saying that there does not exist any fear that also leads to terror. \n\nThe full evaluation would look like this:\n\n```\nPredicate/arity map for the problem: \n ['Fear/1', 'Anxiety/1', 'Terror/1']\n\nTEXT: Some fears lead to anxiety.\nFOL: exists x.

(Fear(x) & Terror(x))\n\nHowever, to determine whether the conclusion \"No fears lead to terror\" follows from the premises, we need to ensure that our logical expressions are consistent with the problem domain. The current formulation does not fully capture the intended meaning of the premises and conclusion. Specifically, the premises only state that there exist some fears leading to anxiety and some anxiety leading to terror, but they do not establish a direct link between fears and terror. Therefore, based on the given premises, we cannot logically conclude that no fears lead to terror. The premises do not provide enough information to support this conclusion.\n\nTo illustrate this, let's evaluate using a theorem prover like Prover9:\n\n```python\nfrom nltk import Expr, FOLExpression\n\n# Define predicates\nFear = FOLExpression('Fear')\nAnxiety = FOLExpression('Anxiety')\nTerror = FOLExpression('Terror')\n\n# Premises\npremise1 = Expr(FOLExpression('exists'), [Expr(FOLExpression('&'), [Fear(x), Anxiety(x)])])\npremise2 = Expr(FOLExpression('exists'), [Expr(FOLExpression('&'), [Anxiety(x), Terror(x)])])\n\n# Conclusion\nconclusion = Expr(FOLExpression('-exists'), [Expr(FOLExpression('&'), [Fear(x), Terror(x)])])\n\n# Print the expressions\nprint(f\"Premise 1: {premise1}\")\nprint(f\"Premise 2: {premise2}\")\nprint(f\"Conclusion: {conclusion}\")\n```\n\nWhen we input these expressions into Prover9, it will attempt to prove the conclusion from the premises. However, Prover9 will likely return that the conclusion does not follow from the premises because the premises do not provide enough information to establish that no fears lead to terror.", "Predicate/arity map for the problem: \n['Fear/1', 'Anxiety/1', 'Terror/1']\n\nTEXT: Some fears lead to anxiety.\nFOL: exists x.

(Fear(x) & Terror(x))\n\nHowever, to determine whether the conclusion \"No fears lead to terror\" follows from the premises, we need to evaluate the logical relationship between these statements. The given premises only establish that some fears lead to anxiety and some anxiety leads to terror, but they do not provide enough information to conclude that no fears lead to terror. \n\nTo illustrate this, let's translate the premises and conclusion into FOL expressions:\n\nTEXT: Some fears lead to anxiety.\nFOL: exists x. (Fear(x) & Anxiety(x))\n\nTEXT: Some anxiety leads to terror.\nFOL: exists x. (Anxiety(x) & Terror(x))\n\nTEXT: No fears lead to terror.\nFOL: -exists x. (Fear(x) & Terror(x))\n\nThe evaluation using a theorem prover like Prover9 would show that the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises. Here's how you might set up the evaluation in Prover9 format:\n\n```\n% Define predicates\nfear(X) :- Fear(X).\nanxiety(X) :- Anxiety(X).\nterror(X) :- Terror(X).\n\n% Premises\nexists X. (fear(X) & anxiety(X)).\nexists X. (anxiety(X) & terror(X)).\n\n% Conclusion\nnot exists X.

From the first premise, we know there exists some fear \\(F_1\\) such that \\(Fear(F_1) \\land Anxiety(F_1)\\).\n2. From the second premise, we know there exists some anxiety \\(A_1\\) such that \\(Anxiety(A_1) \\land Terror(A_1)\\).\n\nHowever, the conclusion states that no fear leads to terror, i.e., for all fears \\(x\\), \\(Fear(x) \\rightarrow -Terror(x)\\).\n\nFrom the premises, we can infer that there is a connection between fears, anxiety, and terror. But the conclusion claims that this connection does not exist, which contradicts the given premises.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"No fears lead to terror\" does not follow from the given premises.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe conclusion \"No fears lead to terror\" does not logically follow from the given premises.", "Predicate/arity map for the problem:\n['Fear/1', 'Anxiety/1', 'Terror/1']\n\nTEXT: Some fears lead to anxiety.\nFOL: exists x.

(Fear(x) & Terror(x))\nThis formulation states that there does not exist any fear that leads directly to terror, which is logically equivalent to saying no fears lead to terror.\n\nHowever, to determine whether the conclusion follows from the premises using a theorem prover like Prover9, we need to ensure the logic is consistent and check for entailment. Here\u2019s how you can structure it:\n\n```python\nfrom nltk import *\n\n# Predicate/arity map\npredicates = ['Fear/1', 'Anxiety/1', 'Terror/1']\n\n# Define the logic expressions\npremise1 = Exists(['x'], And(Fear('x'), Anxiety('x')))\npremise2 = Exists(['x'], And(Anxiety('x'), Terror('x')))\nconclusion = Not(Exists(['x'], And(Fear('x'), Terror('x'))))\n\n# Print the FOL expressions\nprint(\"Premise 1: Some fears lead to anxiety.\")\nprint(premise1)\nprint(\"Premise 2: Some anxiety leads to terror.\")\nprint(premise2)\nprint(\"Conclusion: No fears lead to terror.\")\nprint(conclusion)\n```\n\nNow, you can use a tool like Prover9 to check if the conclusion follows from the premises. The Prover9 command might look something like this:\n\n```plaintext\nthf(premise1, axiom, exists x. (Fear(x) & Anxiety(x))).\nthf(premise2, axiom, exists x. (Anxiety(x) & Terror(x))).\nthf(conclusion, conjecture, ~exists x. (Fear(x) & Terror(x))).\n\nset(theory_file, \"my_theory.txt\").\nrun_prover9.\n```\n\nIf Prover9 can derive the conclusion from the premises, it means the conclusion follows logically from the given premises. Otherwise, it indicates that the conclusion may not be entailed by the premises.", "Predicate/arity map for the problem:\n['Fear/1', 'Anxiety/1', 'Terror/1']\n\nTEXT: Some fears lead to anxiety.\nFOL: exists x. (Fear(x) & Anxiety(x))\n\nTEXT: Some anxiety leads to terror.\nFOL: exists x. (Anxiety(x) & Terror(x))\n\nTEXT: No fears lead to terror.\nFOL: -exists x. (Fear(x) & Terror(x))\nThis last expression needs to be checked for consistency with the premises. We need to use a theorem prover to determine if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. Let's summarize the FOL expressions:\n\n```python\nfrom nltk import *\n\n# Define predicates\nFear = Predicate('Fear', 1)\nAnxiety = Predicate('Anxiety', 1)\nTerror = Predicate('Terror', 1)\n\n# Premises\npremise1 = Exists('x', And(Fear('x'), Anxiety('x')))\npremise2 = Exists('x', And(Anxiety('x'), Terror('x')))\n\n# Conclusion\nconclusion = Not(Exists('x', And(Fear('x'), Terror('x'))))\n\n# Evaluate using a theorem prover\nfrom nltk.proofsearch import Prover9\n\nprover = Prover9()\nresult = prover.apply_proof_methods([premise1, premise2], [conclusion])\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\nWhen we run this code, we expect the theorem prover to check if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. If the conclusion is valid, the prover should return a proof or confirm that the premises entail the conclusion.\n\nLet's proceed with evaluating the logical validity using a theorem prover.\n\n```python\nfrom nltk.proofsearch import Prover9\n\nprover = Prover9()\n\n# Convert premises and conclusion to strings\npremises_str = [str(premise1), str(premise2)]\nconclusion_str = str(conclusion)\n\n# Run the proof search\nresult = prover.apply_proof_methods(premises_str, conclusion_str)\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\nRunning the above code will give us the result from the theorem prover. If the conclusion is valid, it should return a proof or confirmation. If not, it will indicate that the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.", "Predicate/arity map for the problem: \n['Fear/1', 'Anxiety/1', 'Terror/1']\n\nTEXT: Some fears lead to anxiety.\nFOL: exists x. (Fear(x) & Anxiety(x))\n\nTEXT: Some anxiety leads to terror.\nFOL: exists x. (Anxiety(x) & Terror(x))\n\nTEXT: No fears lead to terror.\nFOL: -exists x. (Fear(x) & Terror(x))\n\nHowever, we need to evaluate whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises. To do this, we need to ensure that the FOL expressions are correctly set up and then use a theorem prover like Prover9 to check the validity.\n\nLet's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Translate Premises:**\n   - Some fears lead to anxiety.\n     FOL: exists x. (Fear(x) & Anxiety(x))\n   - Some anxiety leads to terror.\n     FOL: exists x. (Anxiety(x) & Terror(x))\n\n2. **Translate Conclusion:**\n   - No fears lead to terror.\n     FOL: -exists x. (Fear(x) & Terror(x))\n\nNow, we need to input these into Prover9 to check if the conclusion follows from the premises.\n\nHere\u2019s how you would typically input the problem into Prover9:\n\n```prolog\n% Premises\nexists x. (Fear(x) & Anxiety(x))\nexists x. (Anxiety(x) & Terror(x))\n\n% Conclusion\n-not (exists x. (Fear(x) & Terror(x)))\n```\n\nRunning this through Prover9 will help determine if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. \n\nGiven the nature of the premises and the conclusion, let's reason about the logical implications:\n\n- The premise \"some fears lead to anxiety\" means there exists at least one fear that results in anxiety.\n- The premise \"some anxiety leads to terror\" means there exists at least one anxiety that results in terror.\n- However, the conclusion states \"no fears lead to terror,\" which means there does not exist any fear that results in terror.\n\nFrom the premises, we know:\n1. There is at least one fear that leads to anxiety.\n2. There is at least one anxiety that leads to terror.\n\nSince there is no information that directly links fears to terror (or rules out such a link), it is logically possible for a fear to lead to anxiety, and from that anxiety, lead to terror. Therefore, the conclusion \"no fears lead to terror\" does not necessarily follow from the premises.\n\nThus, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.", "Predicate/arity map for the problem: \n['Fear/1', 'Anxiety/1', 'Terror/1']\n\nTEXT: Some fears lead to anxiety.\nFOL: exists x. (Fear(x) & Anxiety(x))\n\nTEXT: Some anxiety leads to terror.\nFOL: exists x. (Anxiety(x) & Terror(x))\n\nTEXT: No fears lead to terror.\nFOL: -exists x. (Fear(x) & Terror(x))\n\nHowever, we need to translate the premises into a form that allows us to evaluate the conclusion using a theorem prover like Prover9. The existential quantifiers need to be converted into universal quantifiers for consistency with the standard format used by Prover9. Here is the corrected evaluation:\n\nTEXT: Some fears lead to anxiety.\nFOL: exists x. (Fear(x) & Anxiety(x)) -> convert to: all x. (Fear(x) -> -Anxiety(x)) -> False\n\nBut for theorem proving, we will use the original form directly.\n\nTEXT: Some anxiety leads to terror.\nFOL: exists x. (Anxiety(x) & Terror(x))\n\nTEXT: No fears lead to terror.\nFOL: -exists x. (Fear(x) & Terror(x)) -> convert to: all x. (Fear(x) -> -Terror(x))\n\nNow, let's put everything together:\n\n```python\n# Premises\npremise1 = \"(exists x. (Fear(x) & Anxiety(x)))\"\npremise2 = \"(exists x. (Anxiety(x) & Terror(x)))\"\npremise3 = \"(-exists x. (Fear(x) & Terror(x)))\"\n\n# Conclusion\nconclusion = \"(-exists x. (Fear(x) & Terror(x)))\"\n\n# Combined FOL expression\nfollist = [premise1, premise2, premise3]\n```\n\nFor Prover9, the input would look like this:\n\n```\nall x. (Fear(x) & Anxiety(x)) -> all x. (Anxiety(x) & Terror(x)) -> all x. (Fear(x) -> -Terror(x))\n```\n\nWe need to ensure that the problem is correctly formulated for Prover9, but based on the logical structure provided, the conclusion \"No fears lead to terror\" does not logically follow from the given premises. The existence of some fears leading to anxiety and some anxiety leading to terror does not imply that no fears lead to terror.

(Surprise(x) -> (Fun(x) | Dreadful(x)))`\n   - `all x. (Scare(x) -> Surprise(x))`\n\n2. **Translate the conclusion into FOL:**\n   - `all x. (Scare(x) -> Fun(x))`\n\n3. **Use a theorem prover like Prover9 to check if the conclusion follows from the premises:**\n\n```python\nfrom nltk import Expression\n\n# Define the predicates\nSurprise = Expression('Surprise', 1)\nFun = Expression('Fun', 1)\nDreadful = Expression('Dreadful', 1)\nScare = Expression('Scare', 1)\n\n# Define the premises\npremise1 = Expression('forall', [Expression('x'), Expression('->', [Surprise(Expression('x')), Expression('|', [Fun(Expression('x')), Dreadful(Expression('x'))])])])\npremise2 = Expression('forall', [Expression('x'), Expression('->', [Scare(Expression('x')), Surprise(Expression('x'))])])\n\n# Define the conclusion\nconclusion = Expression('forall', [Expression('x'), Expression('->', [Scare(Expression('x')), Fun(Expression('x'))])])\n\n# Use a theorem prover to check if the conclusion follows from the premises\n# This step would typically be done using a tool like Prover9 or a similar automated theorem prover.\n# For demonstration purposes, we assume that Prover9 has been used and the result is as follows:\nresult = prover9_check([premise1, premise2], conclusion)\n```\n\nSince we are evaluating the logical validity manually, let's reason through the premises:\n\n1. **Premise 1:** `Surprise(x) -> (Fun(x) | Dreadful(x))` means that if something is a surprise, it is either fun or dreadful.\n2. **Premise 2:** `Scare(x) -> Surprise(x)` means that if something is a scare, it is also a surprise.\n\nBy combining these two premises, we can infer that if something is a scare, it must be a surprise. According to Premise 1, since it is a surprise, it must be either fun or dreadful. However, the conclusion states that all scares are fun, which implies that there is no scenario where a scare could be dreadful.\n\nTo check if this is logically valid, consider the following:\n\n- If a scare is a surprise (Premise 2), and if a surprise is fun or dreadful (Premise 1), then for the conclusion to hold true, every scare must be fun and not dreadful.\n\nHowever, Premise 1 does not exclude the possibility that some surprises might be dreadful. Therefore, the conclusion \"all scares are fun\" cannot be definitively inferred from the given premises.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe conclusion \"all scares are fun\" does not follow logically from the given premises.", "Predicate/arity map for the problem:\n['Fun/1', 'Dreadful/1', 'Scare/1', 'Surprise/1']\n\nTEXT: Surprises are either fun or dreadful.\nFOL: all x.

(Scare(x) -> Fun(x))\n\nThe evaluation in this case is straightforward because we need to check if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. Let's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Premise 1**: `all x. (Surprise(x) -> (Fun(x) | Dreadful(x)))`\n   - This means every surprise is either fun or dreadful.\n\n2. **Premise 2**: `all x. (Scare(x) -> Surprise(x))`\n   - This means every scare is a surprise.\n\nUsing these premises, we can deduce the following:\n\n- From Premise 2, if something is a scare, it is also a surprise.\n- From Premise 1, since it is a surprise, it must be either fun or dreadful.\n\nTherefore, combining these two premises, if something is a scare, it must be fun (because it is a surprise and cannot be dreadful as per the definition of a scare).\n\nThus, the conclusion `all x. (Scare(x) -> Fun(x))` logically follows from the given premises.\n\nTo confirm this using a theorem prover like Prover9, you would input the premises and the negation of the conclusion, and check if the system can derive a contradiction (i.e., show that the premises imply the conclusion).\n\nHere\u2019s how the input might look in Prover9 format:\n\n```\nformulas(assum).\n  all x. (Surprise(x) -> (Fun(x) | Dreadful(x))).\n  all x. (Scare(x) -> Surprise(x)).\nend_of_list.\n\nformulas(qe).\n  all x.

Given the current premises, the conclusion `\u2200x (Bird(x) \u2192 Swim(x))` does not logically follow from the premises, as there is no information that directly links birds to swimming except through hawks, and the existence of hawks does not imply that all birds must swim.", "Let's translate the given premises and conclusion into First-Order Logic (FOL) expressions using the provided predicate/arity map:\n\n**Predicate/arity map for the problem:**\n- `Hawk/1`\n- `Swim/1`\n- `Bird/1`\n\n**Premises:**\n1.
