The sixth premise tells us that a worksheet is either paper or environment-friendly. However, there is no information that directly links the biodegradability of a worksheet to its conclusion. Therefore, the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises.\n\nANSWER: Uncertain\n\n2.\nThe premises are:\n- A La Liga soccer team ranks higher than another La Liga soccer team if it receives more points.\n- If there are two La Liga soccer teams and neither has more points than the other, then the team which receives more points from the games between the two teams ranks higher.\n- Real Madrid and Barcelona are both La Liga soccer teams.\n- Real Madrid received more points than Barcelona.\n- Neither Real Madrid nor Barcelona received more points from the games between them.\n\nThe conclusion is:\nReal Madrid ranks higher than Barcelona.\n\nGiven the information that Real Madrid received more points than Barcelona, and neither team received more points from the games between them, we can conclude that Real Madrid ranks higher than Barcelona.\n\nANSWER: True\n\n3.\nThe premises are:\n- All professional athletes spend most of their time on sports.\n- All Olympic gold medal winners are professional athletes.\n- No full-time scientists spend the majority of their time on sports.\n- All Nobel physics laureates are full-time scientists.\n- Amy spends the most time on sports, or Amy is an Olympic gold medal winner.\n- If Amy is not a Nobel physics laureate, then Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner.\n\nThe conclusion is:\nIf Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner, then Amy is a Nobel physics laureate.\n\nFrom the fourth premise, we know that all Nobel physics laureates are full-time scientists. From the third premise, we know that no full-time scientists spend the majority of their time on sports. This implies that no Nobel physics laureates spend the majority of their time on sports. The fifth premise tells us that Amy either spends the most time on sports or is an Olympic gold medal winner. If Amy is an Olympic gold medal winner, then she is a professional athlete and spends the majority of her time on sports. However, this contradicts the fact that no Nobel physics laureates spend the majority of their time on sports. Therefore, Amy must not be an Olympic gold medal winner. \n\nFrom the sixth premise, we know that if Amy is not a Nobel physics laureate, then she is not an Olympic gold medal winner. Since we have established that Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner, this premise holds. However, this does not necessarily imply that Amy is a Nobel physics laureate. Therefore, the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises.\n\nANSWER: Uncertain\n\n4.\nThe premises are:\n- If a person pays their taxes, then they contribute to the country.\n- Everyone who works for a government department pays a tax on their salary.\n- Everyone in the army is an employee of a government department.\n- Everyone convicted of murder goes to prison.\n- Everyone who has been to prison has a criminal record.\n- James was either once convicted of murder, or spent time in prison.\n- James either has a criminal record, or pays his taxes.\n\nThe conclusion is:\nJames does not contribute to the country.\n\nFrom the first premise, we know that if James pays his taxes, then he contributes to the country. The seventh premise tells us that James either has a criminal record or pays his taxes. If James has a criminal record, then we cannot conclude whether he contributes to the country or not. However, if James pays his taxes, then we know that he contributes to the country. Therefore, the conclusion that James does not contribute to the country does not necessarily follow from the premises.\n\nANSWER: Uncertain\n\n5.\nThe premises are:\n- No songs are visuals.\n- All folk songs are songs.\n- All videos are visuals.\n- All movies are videos.\n- All sci-fi movies are movies.\n- Inception is a sci-fi movie.\n- Mac is neither a folk song nor a sci-fi movie.\n\nThe conclusion is:\nInception is a folk song.\n\nFrom the first premise, we know that no songs are visuals. From the third premise, we know that all videos are visuals. Therefore, no videos are songs. From the fourth premise, we know that all movies are videos. Therefore, no movies are songs. From the fifth premise, we know that all sci-fi movies are movies. Therefore, no sci-fi movies are songs. Since Inception is a sci-fi movie, it is not a song. From the second premise, we know that all folk songs are songs. Therefore, Inception is not a folk song.\n\nANSWER: False\n\n6.\nThe premises are:\n- Every chef can cook.\n- Some people who aren\u2019t chefs can cook.\n- People who cook can make scrambled eggs and pasta.\n- If someone can make cookies and muffins, they are a baker.\n- Bakers who can also make scrambled eggs can make a good breakfast.\n- Luke can make cookies, scrambled eggs, and muffins, but not pasta.\n\nThe conclusion is:\nLuke is a chef.\n\nFrom the fourth premise, we know that if someone can make cookies and muffins, they are a baker. However, the fifth premise tells us that bakers who can also make scrambled eggs can make a good breakfast. Luke can make cookies, scrambled eggs, and muffins, but not pasta. Since he can make scrambled eggs, he can make a good breakfast. However, this does not necessarily imply that he is a baker. From the third premise, we know that people who cook can make scrambled eggs and pasta. Since Luke can make scrambled eggs, he must be able to cook. However, this does not necessarily imply that he is a chef. \n\nTherefore, the conclusion that Luke is a chef does not necessarily follow from the premises.\n\nANSWER: False\n\n7.\nThe premises are:\n- ETS develops various standardized tests primarily in the United States for K-12 and higher education.\n- ETS administers international tests, including the TOEFL, TOEIC, GRE, and subject tests.\n- Many of the assessments ETS develops are associated with entry to the US tertiary and quaternary education institutions.\n- ETS also develops K-12 statewide assessments used for accountability testing in many states.\n\nThe conclusion is:\nETS doesn't administer tests internationally.\n\nFrom the second premise, we know that ETS administers international tests, including the TOEFL, TOEIC, GRE, and subject tests. Therefore, ETS does administer tests internationally. This directly contradicts the conclusion.\n\nANSWER: False\n\n8.\nThe premises are:\n- Daveed Diggs is an actor and film producer.\n- Daveed Diggs played two roles in the musical Hamilton on Broadway.\n- One of the actors from Hamilton won the best actor award.\n- The actor playing Thomas Jefferson won the best actor award.\n- Daveed Diggs played Thomas Jefferson.\n- Musicals on Broadway are not films.\n\nThe conclusion is:\nDaveed Diggs won the best actor award.\n\nFrom the third premise, we know that one of the actors from Hamilton won the best actor award. From the fourth premise, we know that the actor playing Thomas Jefferson won the best actor award. From the fifth premise, we know that Daveed Diggs played Thomas Jefferson. Therefore, Daveed Diggs won the best actor award.\n\nANSWER: True\n\n9.\nThe premises are:\n- Ambiortus is a prehistoric bird genus.\n- Ambiortus Dementjevi is the only known species of Ambiortus.\n- Mongolia was where Ambiortus Dementjevi lived.\n- Yevgeny Kurochkin was the discoverer of Ambiortus.\n\nThe conclusion is:\nYevgeny Kurochkin discovered a new bird genus.\n\nFrom the fourth premise, we know that Yevgeny Kurochkin was the discoverer of Ambiortus. From the second premise, we know that Ambiortus Dementjevi is the only known species of Ambiortus. Therefore, Yevgeny Kurochkin discovered Ambiortus, which is a prehistoric bird genus. This directly supports the conclusion.\n\nANSWER: True", "Here are the evaluations of the conclusions given the premises:\n\n1. The conclusion does not follow from the premises. The premises imply that a worksheet is either paper or environment-friendly, and since paper is biodegradable, a worksheet could be biodegradable. Therefore, the conclusion is uncertain.\n\n2. The conclusion follows from the premises. The premises imply that Real Madrid ranks higher than Barcelona because it received more points than Barcelona, which is a direct consequence of the first premise.\n\n3. The conclusion does not follow from the premises. The premises imply that Amy is either an Olympic gold medal winner or a Nobel physics laureate, but they do not imply that she is an Olympic gold medal winner and a Nobel physics laureate. Therefore, the conclusion is false.\n\n4. The conclusion is uncertain. The premises imply that James either has a criminal record or pays his taxes, but they do not imply that he does not contribute to the country. Therefore, we cannot be certain that the conclusion follows from the premises.\n\n5. The conclusion does not follow from the premises. The premises imply that Inception is a movie, but they do not imply that it is a folk song. Therefore, the conclusion is false.\n\n6. The conclusion does not follow from the premises. The premises imply that Luke is a baker, but they do not imply that he is a chef. Therefore, the conclusion is false.\n\n7. The conclusion does not follow from the premises. The premises imply that ETS administers international tests, including the TOEFL, TOEIC, GRE, and subject tests. Therefore, the conclusion is false.\n\n8. The conclusion does not follow from the premises. The premises imply that Daveed Diggs played Thomas Jefferson in the musical Hamilton and won the best actor award. Therefore, the conclusion is true.\n\n9. The conclusion follows from the premises.

Since paper is biodegradable, a worksheet being a paper would imply that it is biodegradable. However, if a worksheet is environment-friendly, it does not necessarily mean it is biodegradable, as there could be other environment-friendly things that are not biodegradable. Therefore, we cannot conclude that a worksheet is not biodegradable.\n\nANSWER: Uncertain\n\n2.\n\nThe premises are:\n- A La Liga soccer team ranks higher than another La Liga soccer team if it receives more points.\n- If there are two La Liga soccer teams and neither has more points than the other, then the team which receives more points from the games between the two teams ranks higher.\n- Real Madrid and Barcelona are both La Liga soccer teams.\n- Real Madrid received more points than Barcelona.\n- Neither Real Madrid nor Barcelona received more points from the games between them.\n\nThe conclusion is:\n- Real Madrid ranks higher than Barcelona.\n\nFrom the premises, we know that Real Madrid received more points than Barcelona. Therefore, Real Madrid ranks higher than Barcelona.\n\nANSWER: True\n\n3.\n\nThe premises are:\n- All professional athletes spend most of their time on sports.\n- All Olympic gold medal winners are professional athletes.\n- No full-time scientists spend the majority of their time on sports.\n- All Nobel physics laureates are full-time scientists.\n- Amy spends the most time on sports, or Amy is an Olympic gold medal winner.\n- If Amy is not a Nobel physics laureate, then Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner.\n\nThe conclusion is:\n- If Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner, then Amy is a Nobel physics laureate.\n\nFrom the premises, we know that if Amy is not a Nobel physics laureate, she must be an Olympic gold medal winner, as there is no other possibility for her to spend the most time on sports. Therefore, if Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner, it implies that she is not the case that she is an Olympic gold medal winner, but the only other option is being a Nobel physics laureate, so if Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner, then it's uncertain if Amy is a Nobel physics laureate.\n\nHowever, upon re-reading the premises, we can deduce that if Amy is not a Nobel physics laureate, she is indeed an Olympic gold medal winner. But there is no information that Amy is a Nobel physics laureate, or not a Nobel physics laureate. So, we cannot conclude if Amy is a Nobel physics laureate or not. Therefore, we can conclude that if Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner, it doesn't necessarily mean that Amy is a Nobel physics laureate.\n\nANSWER: False\n\n4.\n\nThe premises are:\n- If a person pays their taxes, then they contribute to the country.\n- Everyone who works for a government department pays a tax on their salary.\n- Everyone in the army is an employee of a government department.\n- Everyone convicted of murder goes to prison.\n- Everyone who has been to prison has a criminal record.\n- James was either once convicted of murder, or spent time in prison.\n- James either has a criminal record, or pays his taxes.\n\nThe conclusion is:\n- James does not contribute to the country.\n\nFrom the premises, we know that James either has a criminal record or pays his taxes. However, we cannot conclude that James pays his taxes. Therefore, it is uncertain if James pays his taxes, and thus uncertain if James contributes to the country.\n\nANSWER: Uncertain\n\n5.\n\nThe premises are:\n- No songs are visuals.\n- All folk songs are songs.\n- All videos are visuals.\n- All movies are videos.\n- All sci-fi movies are movies.\n- Inception is a sci-fi movie.\n- Mac is neither a folk song nor a sci-fi movie.\n\nThe conclusion is:\n- Inception is a folk song.\n\nFrom the premises, we can deduce that Inception is a movie, and all movies are videos, and all videos are visuals. Therefore, Inception is a visual. However, no songs are visuals, so Inception is not a song. Since Mac is neither a folk song nor a sci-fi movie, Inception must be a folk song.\n\nHowever, this contradicts the information that Inception is a sci-fi movie and that all sci-fi movies are movies. If Inception is a sci-fi movie, then it cannot be a folk song.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that Inception is not a folk song.\n\nANSWER: False\n\n6.\n\nThe premises are:\n- Every chef can cook.\n- Some people who aren\u2019t chefs can cook.\n- People who cook can make scrambled eggs and pasta.\n- If someone can make cookies and muffins, they are a baker.\n- Bakers who can also make scrambled eggs can make a good breakfast.\n- Luke can make cookies, scrambled eggs, and muffins, but not pasta.\n\nThe conclusion is:\n- Luke is a chef.\n\nFrom the premises, we can deduce that Luke can cook. However, we do not know if Luke is a chef. If Luke is a baker, then he can make a good breakfast, but we do not know if Luke is a baker or not. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Luke is a chef.\n\nANSWER: False\n\n7.\n\nThe premises are:\n- ETS develops various standardized tests primarily in the United States for K-12 and higher education.\n- ETS administers international tests, including the TOEFL, TOEIC, GRE, and subject tests.\n- Many of the assessments ETS develops are associated with entry to the US tertiary and quaternary education institutions.\n- ETS also develops K-12 statewide assessments used for accountability testing in many states.\n\nThe conclusion is:\n- ETS doesn't administer tests internationally.\n\nThis conclusion directly contradicts the information in the premises, which states that ETS administers international tests.\n\nANSWER: False\n\n8.\n\nThe premises are:\n- Daveed Diggs is an actor and film producer.\n- Daveed Diggs played two roles in the musical Hamilton on Broadway.\n- One of the actors from Hamilton won the best actor award.\n- The actor playing Thomas Jefferson won the best actor award.\n- Daveed Diggs played Thomas Jefferson.\n- Musicals on Broadway are not films.\n\nThe conclusion is:\n- Daveed Diggs won the best actor award.\n\nFrom the premises, we can deduce that Daveed Diggs played Thomas Jefferson in the musical Hamilton, and one of the actors from Hamilton won the best actor award. Since Daveed Diggs played Thomas Jefferson, and the actor playing Thomas Jefferson won the best actor award, it implies that Daveed Diggs won the best actor award.\n\nANSWER: True\n\n9.\n\nThe premises are:\n- Ambiortus is a prehistoric bird genus.\n- Ambiortus Dementjevi is the only known species of Ambiortus.\n- Mongolia was where Ambiortus Dementjevi lived.\n- Yevgeny Kurochkin was the discoverer of Ambiortus.\n\nThe conclusion is:\n- Yevgeny Kurochkin lived in Mongolia.\n\nThis conclusion is uncertain, as there is no information in the premises about where Yevgeny Kurochkin lived. \n\nHowever, we can conclude that Yevgeny Kurochkin must have discovered Ambiortus Dementjevi in Mongolia.\n\nSince the conclusion is uncertain, we can't conclude if Yevgeny Kurochkin lived in Mongolia or not.\n\nANSWER: Uncertain", "To solve each problem, I'll use first-order logic and reasoning to evaluate the conclusion as True, False, or Uncertain given the premises.\n\n1. \n<PREMISES>\nAll biodegradable things are environment-friendly.\nAll woodware is biodegradable.\nAll paper is woodware.\nNothing is a good thing and also a bad thing.\nAll environment-friendly things are good.\nA worksheet is either paper or environment-friendly.\n</PREMISES>\n<CONCLUSION>\nA worksheet is not biodegradable.\n</CONCLUSION>\n<EVALUATE>\nANSWER: Uncertain", "I will solve each problem step by step.\n\n\n### Problem 1\n\n<PREMISES>\nAll biodegradable things are environment-friendly.\nAll woodware is biodegradable.\nAll paper is woodware.\nNothing is a good thing and also a bad thing.\nAll environment-friendly things are good.\nA worksheet is either paper or environment-friendly.\n</PREMISES>\n<CONCLUSION>\nA worksheet is not biodegradable.\n</CONCLUSION>\n<EVALUATE>\nANSWER: Uncertain", "I'll evaluate the given FOL problems one by one.\n\n1. <PREMISES>\nAll biodegradable things are environment-friendly.\nAll woodware is biodegradable.\nAll paper is woodware.\nNothing is a good thing and also a bad thing.\nAll environment-friendly things are good.\nA worksheet is either paper or environment-friendly.\n</PREMISES>\n<CONCLUSION>\nA worksheet is not biodegradable.\n</CONCLUSION>\n<EVALUATE>\nANSWER: Uncertain", "Here are the solutions to the given first-order logic problems:\n\n1. \nThe premises are given in the form of a set of first-order logic sentences.\nThe conclusion is given in the form of a single first-order logic sentence.\nThe task is to evaluate the conclusion as ANSWER: True, ANSWER: False, or ANSWER: Uncertain given the premises.\n\n<PREMISES>\nAll biodegradable things are environment-friendly.\nAll woodware is biodegradable.\nAll paper is woodware.\nNothing is a good thing and also a bad thing.\nAll environment-friendly things are good.\nA worksheet is either paper or environment-friendly.\n</PREMISES>\n<CONCLUSION>\nA worksheet is not biodegradable.\n</CONCLUSION>\n<EVALUATE>\nANSWER: False", "Based on the given premises, I will evaluate each conclusion.\n\n1. \n<PREMISES>\nAll biodegradable things are environment-friendly.\nAll woodware is biodegradable.\nAll paper is woodware.\nNothing is a good thing and also a bad thing.\nAll environment-friendly things are good.\nA worksheet is either paper or environment-friendly.\n</PREMISES>\n<CONCLUSION>\nA worksheet is not biodegradable.\n</CONCLUSION>\n<EVALUATE>\nANSWER: False", "To determine whether the conclusion follows from the premises, we can analyze each problem step by step.\n\n1.

Therefore, all paper is biodegradable. We also know that a worksheet is either paper or environment-friendly. Since all environment-friendly things are good, and nothing is a good thing and also a bad thing, we can conclude that a worksheet cannot be both paper and environment-friendly at the same time. However, the premises do not rule out the possibility that a worksheet is paper and therefore biodegradable. Hence, the conclusion that a worksheet is not biodegradable is false.\n\n2. <PREMISES>\nA La Liga soccer team ranks higher than another La Liga soccer team if it receives more points.\nIf there are two La Liga soccer teams and neither has more points than the other, then the team which receives more points from the games between the two teams ranks higher.\nReal Madrid and Barcelona are both La Liga soccer teams.\nReal Madrid received more points than Barcelona.\nNeither Real Madrid nor Barcelona received more points from the games between them.\n</PREMISES>\n<CONCLUSION>\nReal Madrid ranks higher than Barcelona.\n</CONCLUSION>\n<EVALUATE>\nANSWER: True\n\nExplanation: From the premises, we know that Real Madrid received more points than Barcelona.

The problem to evaluate is:\n<premises>\nSix, seven and eight are real numbers.\nIf a real number equals another real number added by one, the first number is larger.\nIf the number x is larger than the number y, then y is not larger than x.\nSeven equals six plus one.\nEight equals seven plus one.\nTwo is positive.\nIf a number is positive, then the double of it is also positive.\nEight is the double of four.\nFour is the double of two.\n</premises>\n<conclusion>\nEight is larger than seven.\n</conclusion>\n<evaluate>\n</evaluate>\n\nSolution:\n- From the premises, we have that eight is the double of four (P8) and four is the double of two (P9). Since two is positive (P7), four is positive (P10) and eight is positive (P11).\n- We also have that eight equals seven plus one (P5).\n- By P2, if a real number equals another real number added by one, the first number is larger. So, eight is larger than seven (P12).\n- However, we also have P3, which states that if the number x is larger than the number y, then y is not larger than x. This is a contrapositive of the original statement. Therefore, seven is not larger than eight (P13).\n- From the given premises, we have that seven is larger than six (P4) and eight is the double of seven (P6). Therefore, eight is larger than six.\n- Based on the given information, eight is larger than seven (P12) and seven is not larger than eight (P13). However, since eight is the double of seven, it is actually larger than seven.\n\nEvaluation: ANSWER: False\n\n2.

So, eight is larger than seven (P12).\n- However, we also have P3, which states that if the number x is larger than the number y, then y is not larger than x. This is a contrapositive of the original statement. Therefore, seven is not larger than eight (P13).\n- From the given premises, we have that seven is larger than six (P4) and eight is the double of seven (P6). Therefore, eight is larger than six.\n- Based on the given information, eight is larger than seven (P12) and seven is not larger than eight (P13).

So, the conclusion is uncertain.\nANSWER: Uncertain", "Here are the solutions to the given FOL problems:\n\n1. \nThe premises are:\n- All biodegradable things are environment-friendly.\n- All woodware is biodegradable.\n- All paper is woodware.\n- Nothing is a good thing and also a bad thing.\n- All environment-friendly things are good.\n- A worksheet is either paper or environment-friendly.\n\nThe conclusion is: \n- A worksheet is not biodegradable.\n\nThe conclusion follows from the premises as follows:\n- From premise 1 and 2, we can infer that all paper is biodegradable.\n- From premise 3, we can infer that all paper is environment-friendly.\n- From premise 5, we can infer that all environment-friendly things are good.\n- Therefore, a worksheet, being environment-friendly, is good.\n- Since nothing is a good thing and also a bad thing (premise 4), a worksheet cannot be biodegradable (if it were, it would be a good and a bad thing at the same time).\n\nANSWER: True\n\n2. \nThe premises are:\n- A La Liga soccer team ranks higher than another La Liga soccer team if it receives more points.\n- If there are two La Liga soccer teams and neither has more points than the other, then the team which receives more points from the games between the two teams ranks higher.\n- Real Madrid and Barcelona are both La Liga soccer teams.\n- Real Madrid received more points than Barcelona.\n- Neither Real Madrid nor Barcelona received more points from the games between them.\n\nThe conclusion is: \n- Real Madrid ranks higher than Barcelona.\n\nThe conclusion follows from the premises as follows:\n- From premise 2, we can infer that the team which receives more points from the games between Real Madrid and Barcelona ranks higher.\n- However, premise 5 states that neither Real Madrid nor Barcelona received more points from the games between them.\n- Therefore, the team which receives more points overall (Real Madrid) ranks higher.\n\nANSWER: True\n\n3. \nThe premises are:\n- All professional athletes spend most of their time on sports.\n- All Olympic gold medal winners are professional athletes.\n- No full-time scientists spend the majority of their time on sports.\n- All Nobel physics laureates are full-time scientists.\n- Amy spends the most time on sports, or Amy is an Olympic gold medal winner.\n- If Amy is not a Nobel physics laureate, then Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner.\n\nThe conclusion is: \n- If Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner, then Amy is a Nobel physics laureate.\n\nThe conclusion does not follow from the premises as follows:\n- From premise 2, we can infer that Amy is either a professional athlete or a Nobel physics laureate.\n- However, premise 5 states that Amy spends the most time on sports, or Amy is an Olympic gold medal winner.\n- Therefore, we cannot conclude that Amy is a Nobel physics laureate if Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner.\n\nANSWER: False\n\n4. \nThe premises are:\n- If a person pays their taxes, then they contribute to the country.\n- Everyone who works for a government department pays a tax on their salary.\n- Everyone in the army is an employee of a government department.\n- Everyone convicted of murder goes to prison.\n- Everyone who has been to prison has a criminal record.\n- James was either once convicted of murder, or spent time in prison.\n- James either has a criminal record, or pays his taxes.\n\nThe conclusion is: \n- James does not contribute to the country.\n\nThe conclusion is uncertain as follows:\n- From premise 1, we can infer that James either contributes to the country or does not contribute to the country.\n- From premise 2 and 3, we can infer that James either works for a government department or is in the army.\n- From premise 4 and 5, we can infer that James either has a criminal record or does not have a criminal record.\n- However, premise 6 states that James was either once convicted of murder, or spent time in prison.\n- If James spent time in prison, then he has a criminal record (premise 5).\n- However, premise 7 states that James either has a criminal record, or pays his taxes.\n- Therefore, we cannot conclude that James does not contribute to the country.\n\nANSWER: Uncertain\n\n5. \nThe premises are:\n- No songs are visuals.\n- All folk songs are songs.\n- All videos are visuals.\n- All movies are videos.\n- All sci-fi movies are movies.\n- Inception is a sci-fi movie.\n- Mac is neither a folk song nor a sci-fi movie.\n\nThe conclusion is: \n- Inception is a folk song.\n\nThe conclusion

However, if a worksheet is environment-friendly, then it is good, but it is not necessarily biodegradable.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion that a worksheet is not biodegradable is uncertain, because a worksheet can be either paper (in which case it is biodegradable) or environment-friendly (in which case its biodegradability is not determined).\n\nANSWER: Uncertain\n\n2.\n\nThe premises are:\n\n- A La Liga soccer team ranks higher than another La Liga soccer team if it receives more points.\n- If there are two La Liga soccer teams and neither has more points than the other, then the team which receives more points from the games between the two teams ranks higher.\n- Real Madrid and Barcelona are both La Liga soccer teams.\n- Real Madrid received more points than Barcelona.\n- Neither Real Madrid nor Barcelona received more points from the games between them.\n\nThe conclusion is:\n\n- Real Madrid ranks higher than Barcelona.\n\nTo evaluate the conclusion, we need to analyze the premises.\n\nFrom the premises, we know that Real Madrid received more points than Barcelona, which implies that Real Madrid ranks higher than Barcelona. The condition that neither team received more points from the games between them is irrelevant to the conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is True.\n\nANSWER: True\n\n3.\n\nThe premises are:\n\n- All professional athletes spend most of their time on sports.\n- All Olympic gold medal winners are professional athletes.\n- No full-time scientists spend the majority of their time on sports.\n- All Nobel physics laureates are full-time scientists.\n- Amy spends the most time on sports, or Amy is an Olympic gold medal winner.\n- If Amy is not a Nobel physics laureate, then Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner.\n\nThe conclusion is:\n\n- If Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner, then Amy is a Nobel physics laureate.\n\nTo evaluate the conclusion, we need to analyze the premises.\n\nFrom the premises, we can deduce that if Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner, then she is not a professional athlete (by the second premise), and therefore, she is not spending most of her time on sports (by the first premise). \n\nHowever, it is also possible that Amy is a full-time scientist and therefore not spending most of her time on sports (by the third premise). If this is the case, then Amy is a Nobel physics laureate (by the fourth premise).\n\nHowever, the fifth premise states that Amy either spends most of her time on sports or is an Olympic gold medal winner. Since we have established that Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner, we can conclude that she must spend most of her time on sports.\n\nThe sixth premise states that if Amy is not a Nobel physics laureate, then Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner. Since we have established that Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner, we can conclude that Amy is a Nobel physics laureate.\n\nHowever, this conclusion is not necessarily true. If Amy is a professional athlete and not an Olympic gold medal winner, then she is still spending most of her time on sports, and the conclusion does not follow.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is False.\n\nANSWER: False\n\n4.\n\nThe premises are:\n\n- If a person pays their taxes, then they contribute to the country.\n- Everyone who works for a government department pays a tax on their salary.\n- Everyone in the army is an employee of a government department.\n- Everyone convicted of murder goes to prison.\n- Everyone who has been to prison has a criminal record.\n- James was either once convicted of murder, or spent time in prison.\n- James either has a criminal record, or pays his taxes.\n\nThe conclusion is:\n\n- James does not contribute to the country.\n\nTo evaluate the conclusion, we need to analyze the premises.\n\nFrom the premises, we can deduce that James either has a criminal record or pays his taxes. If James pays his taxes, then he contributes to the country (by the first premise). However, if James has a criminal record, then it is possible that he does not contribute to the country.\n\nHowever, we cannot conclude that James does not contribute to the country. There are two possible scenarios: either James pays his taxes and contributes to the country, or James has a criminal record and does not contribute to the country.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is Uncertain.\n\nANSWER: Uncertain\n\n5.\n\nThe premises are:\n\n- No songs are visuals.\n- All folk songs are songs.\n- All videos are visuals.\n- All movies are videos.\n- All sci-fi movies are movies.\n- Inception is a sci-fi movie.\n- Mac is neither a folk song nor a sci-fi movie.\n\nThe conclusion is:\n\n- Inception is a folk song.\n\nTo evaluate the conclusion, we need to analyze the premises.\n\nFrom the premises, we can deduce that Inception is a movie (by the fifth premise) and is not a sci-fi movie (by the seventh premise). However, we cannot conclude that Inception is a folk song.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is False.\n\nANSWER: False\n\n6.\n\nThe premises are:\n\n- Every chef can cook.\n- Some people who aren\u2019t chefs can cook.\n- People who cook can make scrambled eggs and pasta.\n- If someone can make cookies and muffins, they are a baker.\n- Bakers who can also make scrambled eggs can make a good breakfast.\n- Luke can make cookies, scrambled eggs, and muffins, but not pasta.\n\nThe conclusion is:\n\n- Luke is a chef.\n\nTo evaluate the conclusion, we need to analyze the premises.\n\nFrom the premises, we can deduce that Luke can cook (by the first premise), because he can make cookies, scrambled eggs, and muffins. However, being able to cook does not necessarily mean that Luke is a chef.\n\nThe second premise states that some people who are not chefs can cook, so we cannot conclude that Luke is a chef based on his ability to cook.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is False.\n\nANSWER: False\n\n7.\n\nThe premises are:\n\n- ETS develops various standardized tests primarily in the United States for K-12 and higher education.\n- ETS administers international tests, including the TOEFL, TOEIC, GRE, and subject tests.\n- Many of the assessments ETS develops are associated with entry to the US tertiary and quaternary education institutions.\n- ETS also develops K-12 statewide assessments used for accountability testing in many states.\n\nThe conclusion is:\n\n- ETS doesn't administer tests internationally.\n\nTo evaluate the conclusion, we need to analyze the premises.\n\nFrom the premises, we can deduce that ETS administers international tests, including the TOEFL, TOEIC, GRE, and subject tests. This contradicts the conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is False.\n\nANSWER: False\n\n8.\n\nThe premises are:\n\n- Daveed Diggs is an actor and film producer.\n- Daveed Diggs played two roles in the musical Hamilton on Broadway.\n- One of the actors from Hamilton won the best actor award.\n- The actor playing Thomas Jefferson won the best actor award.\n- Daveed Diggs played Thomas Jefferson.\n- Musicals on Broadway are not films.\n\nThe conclusion is:\n\n- Daveed Diggs won the best actor award.\n\nTo evaluate the conclusion, we need to analyze the premises.\n\nFrom the premises, we can deduce that Daveed Diggs played Thomas Jefferson in the musical Hamilton, and one of the actors from Hamilton won the best actor award. Therefore, we can conclude that Daveed Diggs won the best actor award.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is True.\n\nANSWER: True", "Here are the evaluations of each conclusion:\n\n1. \n\nThe premises are:\n- All biodegradable things are environment-friendly.\n- All woodware is biodegradable.\n- All paper is woodware.\n- Nothing is a good thing and also a bad thing.\n- All environment-friendly things are good.\n- A worksheet is either paper or environment-friendly.\n\nThe conclusion is:\nA worksheet is not biodegradable.\n\nThis conclusion does not follow from the premises. From the premises, we can conclude that a worksheet is either paper or environment-friendly. Since all paper is woodware and all woodware is biodegradable, a worksheet could be biodegradable. Therefore, the conclusion is False.\n\n2. \n\nThe premises are:\n- A La Liga soccer team ranks higher than another La Liga soccer team if it receives more points.\n- If there are two La Liga soccer teams and neither has more points than the other, then the team which receives more points from the games between the two teams ranks higher.\n- Real Madrid and Barcelona are both La Liga soccer teams.\n- Real Madrid received more points than Barcelona.\n- Neither Real Madrid nor Barcelona received more points from the games between them.\n\nThe conclusion is:\nReal Madrid ranks higher than Barcelona.\n\nThis conclusion follows from the premises. Since Real Madrid received more points than Barcelona, and neither team received more points from the games between them, Real Madrid ranks higher than Barcelona. Therefore, the conclusion is True.\n\n3. \n\nThe premises are:\n- All professional athletes spend most of their time on sports.\n- All Olympic gold medal winners are professional athletes.\n- No full-time scientists spend the majority of their time on sports.\n- All Nobel physics laureates are full-time scientists.\n- Amy spends the most time on sports, or Amy is an Olympic gold medal winner.\n- If Amy is not a Nobel physics laureate, then Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner.\n\nThe conclusion is:\nIf Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner, then Amy is a Nobel physics laureate.\n\nThis conclusion does not follow from the premises. From the premises, we can conclude that Amy is either an Olympic gold medal winner or a full-time scientist (since she spends the most time on sports). However, we cannot conclude that if she is not an Olympic gold medal winner, she is a Nobel physics laureate. Therefore, the conclusion is False.\n\n4. \n\nThe premises are:\n- If a person pays their taxes, then they contribute to the country.\n- Everyone who works for a government department pays a tax on their salary.\n- Everyone in the army is an employee of a government department.\n- Everyone convicted of murder goes to prison.\n- Everyone who has been to prison has a criminal record.\n- James was either once convicted of murder, or spent time in prison.\n- James either has a criminal record, or pays his taxes.\n\nThe conclusion is:\nJames does not contribute to the country.\n\nThis conclusion is Uncertain. From the premises, we know that James either has a criminal record or pays his taxes. If he pays his taxes, then he contributes to the country. However, we do not have enough information to conclude that James does not pay his taxes. Therefore, the conclusion is Uncertain.\n\n5. \n\nThe premises are:\n- No songs are visuals.\n- All folk songs are songs.\n- All videos are visuals.\n- All movies are videos.\n- All sci-fi movies are movies.\n- Inception is a sci-fi movie.\n- Mac is neither a folk song nor a sci-fi movie.\n\nThe conclusion is:\nInception is a folk song.\n\nThis conclusion does not follow from the premises. From the premises, we can conclude that Inception is not a folk song (since it is a sci-fi movie and Mac is not a folk song either). Therefore, the conclusion is False.\n\n6. \n\nThe premises are:\n- Every chef can cook.\n- Some people who aren\u2019t chefs can cook.\n- People who cook can make scrambled eggs and pasta.\n- If someone can make cookies and muffins, they are a baker.\n- Bakers who can also make scrambled eggs can make a good breakfast.\n- Luke can make cookies, scrambled eggs, and muffins, but not pasta.\n\nThe conclusion is:\nLuke is a chef.\n\nThis conclusion does not follow from the premises. From the premises, we can conclude that Luke can make scrambled eggs and cookies, but not pasta. This does not necessarily mean that Luke is a chef. Therefore, the conclusion is False.\n\n7. \n\nThe premises are:\n- ETS develops various standardized tests primarily in the United States for K-12 and higher education.\n- ETS administers international tests, including the TOEFL, TOEIC, GRE, and subject tests.\n- Many of the assessments ETS develops are associated with entry to the US tertiary and quaternary education institutions.\n- ETS also develops K-12 statewide assessments used for accountability testing in many states.\n\nThe conclusion is:\nETS doesn't administer tests internationally.\n\nThis conclusion does not follow from the premises. From the premises, we can conclude that ETS administers international tests, including the TOEFL, TOEIC, GRE, and subject tests. Therefore, the conclusion is False.\n\n8. \n\nThe premises are:\n- Daveed Diggs is an actor and film producer.\n- Daveed Diggs played two roles in the musical Hamilton on Broadway.\n- One of the actors from Hamilton won the best actor award.\n- The actor playing Thomas Jefferson won the best actor award.\n- Daveed Diggs played Thomas Jefferson.\n- Musicals on Broadway are not films.\n\nThe conclusion is:\nDaveed Diggs won the best actor award.\n\nThis conclusion follows from the premises. Since Daveed Diggs played Thomas Jefferson in Hamilton, and the actor playing Thomas Jefferson won the best actor award, Daveed Diggs won the best actor award. Therefore, the conclusion is True.\n\n9. \n\nThe premises are:\n- All artificial satellites are important scientific achievements.\n- Some artificial satellites are not U.S. inventions.\n\nThe conclusion is:\nAll important scientific achievements are U.S. inventions.\n\nThis conclusion does not follow from the premises. From the premises, we can conclude that some important scientific achievements are not U.S. inventions (since some artificial satellites are not U.S. inventions). Therefore, the conclusion is False.", "<PREMISES>\nAll biodegradable things are environment-friendly.\nAll woodware is biodegradable.\nAll paper is woodware.\nNothing is a good thing and also a bad thing.\nAll environment-friendly things are good.\nA worksheet is either paper or environment-friendly.\n</PREMISES>\n<CONCLUSION>\nA worksheet is not biodegradable.\n</CONCLUSION>\n<EVALUATE>\nTo evaluate this conclusion, we can start by analyzing the premises. The first three premises state that biodegradable things are environment-friendly, woodware is biodegradable, and paper is woodware.

paper is woodware.\n- Nothing is a good thing and also a bad thing.\n- All environment-friendly things are good.\n- A worksheet is either paper or environment-friendly.\n\nConclusion:\n- A worksheet is not biodegradable.\n\nEvaluation: \n- If a worksheet is environment-friendly, then it is biodegradable (by the first premise).\n- If a worksheet is paper, then it is biodegradable (by the third premise and the second premise).\n- Since a worksheet is either paper or environment-friendly, it is biodegradable in either case.\n- Therefore, the conclusion \"A worksheet is not biodegradable\" does not follow from the premises.\n\nANSWER: ANSWER: False\n\n### Problem 2\nGiven the premises:\n- A La Liga soccer team ranks higher than another La Liga soccer team if it receives more points.\n- If there are two La Liga soccer teams and neither has more points than the other, then the team which receives more points from the games between the two teams ranks higher.\n- Real Madrid and Barcelona are both La Liga soccer teams.\n- Real Madrid received more points than Barcelona.\n- Neither Real Madrid nor Barcelona received more points from the games between them.\n\nConclusion:\n- Real Madrid ranks higher than Barcelona.\n\nEvaluation:\n- By the first premise, if Real Madrid receives more points than Barcelona, then Real Madrid ranks higher than Barcelona.\n- The second premise is irrelevant because Real Madrid receives more points than Barcelona, which satisfies the first premise.\n- Therefore, the conclusion \"Real Madrid ranks higher than Barcelona\" follows from the premises.\n\nANSWER: ANSWER: True\n\n### Problem 3\nGiven the premises:\n- All professional athletes spend most of their time on sports.\n- All Olympic gold medal winners are professional athletes.\n- No full-time scientists spend the majority of their time on sports.\n- All Nobel physics laureates are full-time scientists.\n- Amy spends the most time on sports, or Amy is an Olympic gold medal winner.\n- If Amy is not a Nobel physics laureate, then Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner.\n\nConclusion:\n- If Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner, then Amy is a Nobel physics laureate.\n\nEvaluation:\n- The conclusion is a contrapositive of the fourth premise, which is \"If Amy is a Nobel physics laureate, then Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner\".\n- The fifth premise does not support the conclusion.\n- By the third premise and the fourth premise, Amy is not a full-time scientist.\n- Therefore, Amy is not a Nobel physics laureate, and the conclusion does

Since professional athletes do not spend most of their time on sports, Amy must not be an Olympic gold medal winner. Therefore, Amy must be a Nobel physics laureate. However, the conclusion states \"If Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner, then Amy is a Nobel physics laureate\", which is equivalent to saying \"If Amy is a Nobel physics laureate, then Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner\". This is the contrapositive of the original statement. Since the original statement is True, the contrapositive is also True.

Since James was either once convicted of murder or spent time in prison, and everyone who has been to prison has a criminal record, James has a criminal record. Therefore, James does not pay his taxes, and thus does not contribute to the country. However, the premises do not provide any information about whether James contributes to the country directly.

Since all paper is woodware, and all woodware is biodegradable, we can conclude that a worksheet is biodegradable if it is paper. However, we cannot conclude that a worksheet is not biodegradable. Therefore, the conclusion is uncertain.\n\n2. \n\nThe premises are:\n- A La Liga soccer team ranks higher than another La Liga soccer team if it receives more points.\n- If there are two La Liga soccer teams and neither has more points than the other, then the team which receives more points from the games between the two teams ranks higher.\n- Real Madrid and Barcelona are both La Liga soccer teams.\n- Real Madrid received more points than Barcelona.\n- Neither Real Madrid nor Barcelona received more points from the games between them.\n\nThe conclusion is:\nReal Madrid ranks higher than Barcelona.\n\nSince Real Madrid received more points than Barcelona, and neither team received more points from the games between them, we can conclude that Real Madrid ranks higher than Barcelona.\n\n3. \n\nThe premises are:\n- All professional athletes spend most of their time on sports.\n- All Olympic gold medal winners are professional athletes.\n- No full-time scientists spend the majority of their time on sports.\n- All Nobel physics laureates are full-time scientists.\n- Amy spends the most time on sports, or Amy is an Olympic gold medal winner.\n- If Amy is not a Nobel physics laureate, then Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner.\n\nThe conclusion is:\nIf Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner, then Amy is a Nobel physics laureate.\n\nWe can deduce that if Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner, then she does not spend the most time on sports (since all Olympic gold medal winners are professional athletes, and all professional athletes spend most of their time on sports). However, we cannot conclude that Amy is a Nobel physics laureate. Therefore, the conclusion is false.\n\n4. \n\nThe premises are:\n- If a person pays their taxes, then they contribute to the country.\n- Everyone who works for a government department pays a tax on their salary.\n- Everyone in the army is an employee of a government department.\n- Everyone convicted of murder goes to prison.\n- Everyone who has been to prison has a criminal record.\n- James was either once convicted of murder, or spent time in prison.\n- James either has a criminal record, or pays his taxes.\n\nThe conclusion is:\nJames does not contribute to the country.\n\nWe can deduce that James either has a criminal record or pays his taxes. However, we cannot conclude that James does not contribute to the country. Therefore, the conclusion is uncertain.\n\n5. \n\nThe premises are:\n- No songs are visuals.\n- All folk songs are songs.\n- All videos are visuals.\n- All movies are videos.\n- All sci-fi movies are movies.\n- Inception is a sci-fi movie.\n- Mac is neither a folk song nor a sci-fi movie.\n\nThe conclusion is:\nInception is a folk song.\n\nWe can deduce that Inception is a movie, and all movies are videos, and all videos are visuals. Therefore, Inception is not a song, and thus cannot be a folk song. Therefore, the conclusion is false.\n\n6. \n\nThe premises are:\n- Every chef can cook.\n- Some people who aren\u2019t chefs can cook.\n- People who cook can make scrambled eggs and pasta.\n- If someone can make cookies and muffins, they are a baker.\n- Bakers who can also make scrambled eggs can make a good breakfast.\n- Luke can make cookies, scrambled eggs, and muffins, but not pasta.\n\nThe conclusion is:\nLuke is a chef.\n\nWe can deduce that Luke can make scrambled eggs, but he cannot make pasta. Therefore, Luke cannot be a chef, since all chefs can cook, and people who cook can make scrambled eggs and pasta. Therefore, the conclusion is false.\n\n7. \n\nThe premises are:\n- ETS develops various standardized tests primarily in the United States for K-12 and higher education.\n- ETS administers international tests, including the TOEFL, TOEIC, GRE, and subject tests.\n- Many of the assessments ETS develops are associated with entry to the US tertiary and quaternary education institutions.\n- ETS also develops K-12 statewide assessments used for accountability testing in many states.\n\nThe conclusion is:\nETS doesn't administer tests internationally.\n\nWe can deduce that ETS administers international tests, including the TOEFL, TOEIC, GRE, and subject tests. Therefore, the conclusion is false.\n\n8. \n\nThe premises are:\n- Daveed Diggs is an actor and film producer.\n- Daveed Diggs played two roles in the musical Hamilton on Broadway.\n- One of the actors from Hamilton won the best actor award.\n- The actor playing Thomas Jefferson won the best actor award.\n- Daveed Diggs played Thomas Jefferson.\n- Musicals on Broadway are not films.\n\nThe conclusion is:\nDaveed Diggs won the best actor award.\n\nWe can deduce that Daveed Diggs played Thomas Jefferson, and the actor playing Thomas Jefferson won the best actor award.

The premises are:\n   - A La Liga soccer team ranks higher than another La Liga soccer team if it receives more points.\n   - If there are two La Liga soccer teams and neither has more points than the other, then the team which receives more points from the games between the two teams ranks higher.\n   - Real Madrid and Barcelona are both La Liga soccer teams.\n   - Real Madrid received more points than Barcelona.\n   - Neither Real Madrid nor Barcelona received more points from the games between them.\n\n   The conclusion is: Real Madrid ranks higher than Barcelona.\n\n   From the premises, we can deduce that Real Madrid received more points than Barcelona, and neither team received more points from the games between them. According to the first premise, the team with more points ranks higher. Hence, Real Madrid ranks higher than Barcelona.\n\n   ANSWER: True\n\n3. The premises are:\n   - All professional athletes spend most of their time on sports.\n   - All Olympic gold medal winners are professional athletes.\n   - No full-time scientists spend the majority of their time on sports.\n   - All Nobel physics laureates are full-time scientists.\n   - Amy spends the most time on sports, or Amy is an Olympic gold medal winner.\n   - If Amy is not a Nobel physics laureate, then Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner.\n\n   The conclusion is: If Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner, then Amy is a Nobel physics laureate.\n\n   From the premises, we can deduce that Amy is either an Olympic gold medal winner or a full-time scientist (since the only other option, spending most time on sports, is exclusive). The second premise states that Olympic gold medal winners are professional athletes, and the first premise states that professional athletes do not spend the majority of their time on sports. Therefore, Amy is a full-time scientist. The fourth premise states that all Nobel physics laureates are full-time scientists. However, the second premise also states that Amy is an Olympic gold medal winner, which would make her a professional athlete, contradicting the fact that she's a full-time scientist. Hence, the conclusion is false.\n\n   ANSWER: False\n\n4. The premises are:\n   - If a person pays their taxes, then they contribute to the country.\n   - Everyone who works for a government department pays a tax on their salary.\n   - Everyone in the army is an employee of a government department.\n   - Everyone convicted of murder goes to prison.\n   - Everyone who has been to prison has a criminal record.\n   - James was either once convicted of murder, or spent time in prison.\n   - James either has a criminal record, or pays his taxes.\n\n   The conclusion is: James does not contribute to the country.\n\n   From the premises, we can deduce that James either has a criminal record or pays his taxes. If James has a criminal record, it's possible that he's in prison, which would make him contribute to the country (as a prisoner) if he pays his taxes, which contradicts the conclusion. If James pays his taxes, he would contribute to the country, which again contradicts the conclusion. Hence, the conclusion is uncertain.\n\n   ANSWER: Uncertain\n\n5. The premises are:\n   - No songs are visuals.\n   - All folk songs are songs.\n   - All videos are visuals.\n   - All movies are videos.\n   - All sci-fi movies are movies.\n   - Inception is a sci-fi movie.\n   - Mac is neither a folk song nor a sci-fi movie.\n\n   The conclusion is: Inception is a folk song.\n\n   From the premises, we can deduce that Inception is a movie (since it's a sci-fi movie), and movies are videos (since all movies are videos). Videos are visuals (since all videos are visuals). The first premise states that no songs are visuals. Hence, Inception is not a folk song (since it's a visual and no songs are visuals), making the conclusion false.\n\n   ANSWER: False\n\n6. The premises are:\n   - Every chef can cook.\n   - Some people who aren\u2019t chefs can cook.\n   - People who cook can make scrambled eggs and pasta.\n   - If someone can make cookies and muffins, they are a baker.\n   - Bakers who can also make scrambled eggs can make a good breakfast.\n   - Luke can make cookies, scrambled eggs, and muffins, but not pasta.\n\n   The conclusion is: Luke is a chef.\n\n   From the premises, we can deduce that Luke is a baker (since he can make cookies and muffins). However, bakers who can make scrambled eggs can make a good breakfast, which is something that people who cook can do. The second premise states that some people who aren't chefs can cook. Therefore, Luke is not necessarily a chef. Hence, the conclusion is false.\n\n   ANSWER: False\n\n7. The premises are:\n   - ETS develops various standardized tests primarily in the United States for K-12 and higher education.\n   - ETS administers international tests, including the TOEFL, TOEIC, GRE, and subject tests.\n   - Many of the assessments ETS develops are associated with entry to the US tertiary and quaternary education institutions.\n   - ETS also develops K-12 statewide assessments used for accountability testing in many states.\n\n   The conclusion is: ETS doesn't administer tests internationally.\n\n   From the premises, we can deduce that ETS administers international tests, including the TOEFL, TOEIC, GRE, and subject tests. Hence, the conclusion is false.\n\n   ANSWER: False\n\n8. The premises are:\n   - Daveed Diggs is an actor and film producer.\n   - Daveed Diggs played two roles in the musical Hamilton on Broadway.\n   - One of the actors from Hamilton won the best actor award.\n   - The actor playing Thomas Jefferson won the best actor award.\n   - Daveed Diggs played Thomas Jefferson.\n   - Musicals on Broadway are not films.\n\n   The conclusion is: Daveed Diggs won the best actor award.\n\n   From the premises, we can deduce that Daveed Diggs played Thomas Jefferson in the musical Hamilton on Broadway, and the actor playing Thomas Jefferson won the best actor award. Hence, Daveed Diggs won the best actor award.\n\n   ANSWER: True\n\n9. The premises are:\n   - Donald Ervin Knuth is an American computer scientist, mathematician, and Professor Emeritus at Stanford University.\n   - Knuth has been called the \"father of the analysis of algorithms.\"\n\n   The conclusion is: An American scientist has been called the \"father of the analysis of algorithms\".\n\n   From the premises, we can deduce that Donald Ervin Knuth is an American scientist, and he has been called the \"father of the analysis of algorithms\". Hence, an American scientist has been called the \"father of the analysis of algorithms\", making the conclusion true.\n\n   ANSWER: True"], "answers": ["True", "True", "True", "Uncertain", "Uncertain", "Uncertain", "Uncertain", "True", "True", "Uncertain"], "reference": "True", "time_total": 258.9373564720154, "time_llm": 258.93678975105286, "prompt_length": 4536}

Therefore, if Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner, it does not necessarily mean she is a Nobel physics laureate, as she could still be a professional athlete.\n\nANSWER: False\n\n4.\n\nThe premises are:\n\n* If a person pays their taxes, then they contribute to the country.\n* Everyone who works for a government department pays a tax on their salary.\n* Everyone in the army is an employee of a government department.\n* Everyone convicted of murder goes to prison.\n* Everyone who has been to prison has a criminal record.\n* James was either once convicted of murder, or spent time in prison.\n* James either has a criminal record, or pays his taxes.\n\nThe conclusion is:\n\n* James does not contribute to the country.\n\nTo evaluate the conclusion, we need to determine if it follows from the premises.\n\nFrom the premises, we know that if James paid his taxes, he would contribute to the country. However, we also know that James either has a criminal record or pays his taxes, but we do not know if he actually pays his taxes. If James has a criminal record, it does not necessarily mean he does not contribute to the country, as he could still pay his taxes. Therefore, the conclusion is uncertain.\n\nANSWER: Uncertain\n\n5.\n\nThe premises are:\n\n* No songs are visuals.\n* All folk songs are songs.\n* All videos are visuals.\n* All movies are videos.\n* All sci-fi movies are movies.\n* Inception is a sci-fi movie.\n* Mac is neither a folk song nor a sci-fi movie.\n\nThe conclusion is:\n\n* Inception is a folk song.\n\nTo evaluate the conclusion, we need to determine if it follows from the premises.\n\nFrom the premises, we know that Inception is a sci-fi movie, and all sci-fi movies are movies. However, we do not know if Inception is a folk song. Since Mac is neither a folk song nor a sci-fi movie, and Inception is a sci-fi movie, this implies that Inception is not a folk song.\n\nANSWER: False\n\n6.\n\nThe premises are:\n\n* Every chef can cook.\n* Some people who aren\u2019t chefs can cook.\n* People who cook can make scrambled eggs and pasta.\n* If someone can make cookies and muffins, they are a baker.\n* Bakers who can also make scrambled eggs can make a good breakfast.\n* Luke can make cookies, scrambled eggs, and muffins, but not pasta.\n\nThe conclusion is:\n\n* Luke is a chef.\n\nTo evaluate the conclusion, we need to determine if it follows from the premises.\n\nFrom the premises, we know that Luke can cook, but we do not know if he is a chef. Since Luke can make cookies, scrambled eggs, and muffins, but not pasta, this implies that he can make a good breakfast. However, this does not necessarily mean he is a chef. \n\nANSWER: False\n\n7.\n\nThe premises are:\n\n* ETS develops various standardized tests primarily in the United States for K-12 and higher education.\n* ETS administers international tests, including the TOEFL, TOEIC, GRE, and subject tests.\n* Many of the assessments ETS develops are associated with entry to the US tertiary and quaternary education institutions.\n* ETS also develops K-12 statewide assessments used for accountability testing in many states.\n\nThe conclusion is:\n\n* ETS doesn't administer tests internationally.\n\nTo evaluate the conclusion, we need to determine if it follows from the premises.\n\nFrom the premises, we know that ETS administers international tests. Therefore, the conclusion does not follow from the premises.\n\nANSWER: False\n\n8.\n\nThe premises are:\n\n* Daveed Diggs is an actor and film producer.\n* Daveed Diggs played two roles in the musical Hamilton on Broadway.\n* One of the actors from Hamilton won the best actor award.\n* The actor playing Thomas Jefferson won the best actor award.\n* Daveed Diggs played Thomas Jefferson.\n* Musicals on Broadway are not films.\n\nThe conclusion is:\n\n* Daveed Diggs won the best actor award.\n\nTo evaluate the conclusion, we need to determine if it follows from the premises.\n\nFrom the premises, we know that Daveed Diggs played Thomas Jefferson in the musical Hamilton on Broadway, and the actor playing Thomas Jefferson won the best actor award. Therefore, since Daveed Diggs won the best actor award as Thomas Jefferson, the conclusion follows from the premises.\n\nANSWER: True\n\n9.\n\nThe premises are:\n\n* China is one of the BRICS, and its economy is emerging.\n* If someone is from China, then they are from a country of BRICS.\n* India is one of the BRICS, and its economy is emerging.\n* If someone is from India, then they are in a country of BRICS.\n* All people from China are Chinese people.\n* All people from India are Indian people.\n* There is a person from India.\n\nThe conclusion is:\n\n* No people from BRICS are Indian people.\n\nTo evaluate the conclusion, we need to determine if it follows from the premises.\n\nFrom the premises, we know that there is a person from India, and all people from India are Indian people. However, we also know that India is one of the BRICS, which means some people from India are people from BRICS.

The conclusion \"A worksheet is not biodegradable\" does not follow from the premises because \"All biodegradable things are environment-friendly\" and \"All paper is woodware\" do not provide any information about whether a worksheet is biodegradable or not. ANSWER: Uncertain\n\n2. The conclusion \"Real Madrid ranks higher than Barcelona\" follows from the premises because the first premise establishes a ranking based on points, and the third premise shows that neither team has more points, but the second premise then establishes that the team with more points from their games against each other is the one that ranks higher, which in this case is Real Madrid. ANSWER: True\n\n3. The conclusion \"If Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner, then Amy is a Nobel physics laureate\" does not follow from the premises because the first premise states that \"Amy spends the most time on sports, or Amy is an Olympic gold medal winner\" and the second premise states that \"If Amy is not a Nobel physics laureate, then Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner\", which together imply that if Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner, then she must be a Nobel physics laureate, but the premises do not provide any information about whether Amy is an Olympic gold medal winner or a Nobel physics laureate. However, since the conclusion is a conditional statement, the premises do not provide enough information to determine whether the conclusion is true or false, so the correct answer is Uncertain is not correct, but rather ANSWER: False is not correct either, as the conclusion is not true but also not false.

The conclusion \"Alba Roversi uses an Italian surname\" is redundant because the first premise states that \"Roversi is an Italian surname\" and the second premise states that \"Alba Roversi uses Roversi as a surname\", which together imply that Alba Roversi uses an Italian surname. However, this is not an evaluation of whether the conclusion follows from the premises, it's just an evaluation of the conclusion itself. The correct answer is ANSWER: True.", "Here are the solutions to the given problems:\n\n1. The conclusion \"A worksheet is not biodegradable\" does not necessarily follow from the premises. \nGiven the premises, we can infer that a worksheet is either paper or environment-friendly. We also know that all woodware is biodegradable and all paper is woodware, so a worksheet that is paper would be biodegradable. However, we cannot conclude that a worksheet is not biodegradable. Therefore, the answer is ANSWER: Uncertain.\n\n2. The conclusion \"Real Madrid ranks higher than Barcelona\" follows from the premises.\nGiven the premises, we know that Real Madrid received more points than Barcelona. We also know that if there are two La Liga soccer teams and neither has more points than the other, then the team which receives more points from the games between the two teams ranks higher. However, we are given that neither Real Madrid nor Barcelona received more points from the games between them. Therefore, Real Madrid must rank higher than Barcelona. Therefore, the answer is ANSWER: True.\n\n3. The conclusion \"If Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner, then Amy is a Nobel physics laureate\" does not follow from the premises.\nGiven the premises, we know that Amy spends the most time on sports, or Amy is an Olympic gold medal winner. We also know that no full-time scientists spend the majority of their time on sports and all Nobel physics laureates are full-time scientists. However, we cannot conclude that Amy is a Nobel physics laureate if she is not an Olympic gold medal winner. Therefore, the answer is ANSWER: False.\n\n4. The conclusion \"James does not contribute to the country\" does not necessarily follow from the premises.\nGiven the premises, we know that James was either once convicted of murder, or spent time in prison. We also know that James either has a criminal record, or pays his taxes. However, we cannot conclude that James does not contribute to the country. Therefore, the answer is ANSWER: Uncertain.\n\n5. The conclusion \"Inception is a folk song\" does not follow from the premises.\nGiven the premises, we know that no songs are visuals and all folk songs are songs. We also know that all videos are visuals and all movies are videos. However, we cannot conclude that Inception is a folk song. In fact, we are given that Inception is a sci-fi movie, which is a subset of movies, and none of the premises provide any information about Inception being a folk song. Therefore, the answer is ANSWER: False.\n\n6. The conclusion \"Luke is a chef\" does not follow from the premises.\nGiven the premises, we know that every chef can cook and people who cook can make scrambled eggs and pasta. We also know that Luke can make cookies, scrambled eggs, and muffins, but not pasta. However, we are given that some people who aren\u2019t chefs can cook, so we cannot conclude that Luke is a chef. Therefore, the answer is ANSWER: False.\n\n7. The conclusion \"ETS doesn't administer tests internationally\" does not follow from the premises.\nGiven the premises, we know that ETS develops various standardized tests primarily in the United States for K-12 and higher education, and ETS administers international tests, including the TOEFL, TOEIC, GRE, and subject tests. Therefore, we can conclude that ETS does administer tests internationally. Therefore, the answer is ANSWER: False.\n\n8. The conclusion \"Daveed Diggs won the best actor award\" follows from the premises.\nGiven the premises, we know that Daveed Diggs played Thomas Jefferson in the musical Hamilton on Broadway, and the actor playing Thomas Jefferson won the best actor award. Therefore, we can conclude that Daveed Diggs won the best actor award. Therefore, the answer is ANSWER: True.\n\n9. The conclusion \"Alba Roversi uses an Italian surname\" follows from the premises.\nGiven the premises, we know that Alba Roversi uses Roversi as a surname and Roversi is an Italian surname. Therefore, we can conclude that Alba Roversi uses an Italian surname. Therefore, the answer is ANSWER: True.", "Based on the given FOL problems, I will evaluate each conclusion as ANSWER: True, ANSWER: False, or ANSWER: Uncertain given the premises.\n\n1. <PREMISES>\nAll biodegradable things are environment-friendly.\nAll woodware is biodegradable.\nAll paper is woodware.\nNothing is a good thing and also a bad thing.\nAll environment-friendly things are good.\nA worksheet is either paper or environment-friendly.\n</PREMISES>\n<CONCLUSION>\nA worksheet is not biodegradable.\n</CONCLUSION>\n<EVALUATE>\nSince a worksheet is either paper or environment-friendly, and all paper is woodware and all woodware is biodegradable, it is uncertain whether a worksheet is biodegradable or not, without knowing whether it is paper or environment-friendly.\nANSWER: Uncertain", "I'll go through each problem and determine whether the conclusion follows from the premises.\n\n1.\n<PREMISES>\nAll biodegradable things are environment-friendly.\nAll woodware is biodegradable.\nAll paper is woodware.\nNothing is a good thing and also a bad thing.\nAll environment-friendly things are good.\nA worksheet is either paper or environment-friendly.\n</PREMISES>\n<CONCLUSION>\nA worksheet is not biodegradable.\n</CONCLUSION>\n<EVALUATE>\nANSWER: False", "To solve these problems, we will use the following method:\n\n1.

If it is paper, then it is biodegradable. If it is environment-friendly, then it is good, but we cannot conclude its biodegradability from this information alone. The statement \"nothing is a good thing and also a bad thing\" implies that environment-friendly things are not biodegradable. However, this contradicts the first premise. Therefore, we cannot determine whether a worksheet is biodegradable or not from the premises. So, the evaluation is:\n- ANSWER: Uncertain\n\n2.\nThe premises are:\n- A La Liga soccer team ranks higher than another La Liga soccer team if it receives more points.\n- If there are two La Liga soccer teams and neither has more points than the other, then the team which receives more points from the games between the two teams ranks higher.\n- Real Madrid and Barcelona are both La Liga soccer teams.\n- Real Madrid received more points than Barcelona.\n- Neither Real Madrid nor Barcelona received more points from the games between them.\nThe conclusion is:\n- Real Madrid ranks higher than Barcelona.\nFrom the premises, we can conclude that Real Madrid received more points than Barcelona, and since there is no information that suggests the points from their games would change the ranking, we can directly conclude that Real Madrid ranks higher than Barcelona. So, the evaluation is:\n- ANSWER: True\n\n3.\nThe premises are:\n- All professional athletes spend most of their time on sports.\n- All Olympic gold medal winners are professional athletes.\n- No full-time scientists spend the majority of their time on sports.\n- All Nobel physics laureates are full-time scientists.\n- Amy spends the most time on sports, or Amy is an Olympic gold medal winner.\n- If Amy is not a Nobel physics laureate, then Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner.\nThe conclusion is:\n- If Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner, then Amy is a Nobel physics laureate.\nWe can deduce that Amy is either an Olympic gold medal winner or a Nobel physics laureate because being an Olympic gold medal winner and being a Nobel physics laureate are mutually exclusive. Since Amy spends the most time on sports, she must be an Olympic gold medal winner. Therefore, the conclusion that if Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner, then she is a Nobel physics laureate is false. So, the evaluation is:\n- ANSWER: False\n\n4.\nThe premises are:\n- If a person pays their taxes, then they contribute to the country.\n- Everyone who works for a government department pays a tax on their salary.\n- Everyone in the army is an employee of a government department.\n- Everyone convicted of murder goes to prison.\n- Everyone who has been to prison has a criminal record.\n- James was either once convicted of murder, or spent time in prison.\n- James either has a criminal record, or pays his taxes.\nThe conclusion is:\n- James does not contribute to the country.\nIf James has a criminal record, then he was either once convicted of murder or spent time in prison, and in both cases, he cannot be paying his taxes. However, this does not provide enough information to conclude that James does not contribute to the country. We can only conclude that James does not contribute to the country if we can determine that James has a criminal record and is not paying his taxes. The premises do not provide enough information to make this conclusion. So, the evaluation is:\n- ANSWER: Uncertain\n\n5.\nThe premises are:\n- No songs are visuals.\n- All folk songs are songs.\n- All videos are visuals.\n- All movies are videos.\n- All sci-fi movies are movies.\n- Inception is a sci-fi movie.\n- Mac is neither a folk song nor a sci-fi movie.\nThe conclusion is:\n- Inception is a folk song.\nFrom the premises, we can deduce that Inception is a movie. Since Inception is not a folk song and it is not a sci-fi movie, but we know that all movies are videos and all videos are visuals, then Inception is a visual. Since all folk songs are songs, and no songs are visuals, Inception cannot be a folk song. So, the evaluation is:\n- ANSWER: False\n\n6.\nThe premises are:\n- Every chef can cook.\n- Some people who aren\u2019t chefs can cook.\n- People who cook can make scrambled eggs and pasta.\n- If someone can make cookies and muffins, they are a baker.\n- Bakers who can also make scrambled eggs can make a good breakfast.\n- Luke can make cookies, scrambled eggs, and muffins, but not pasta.\nThe conclusion is:\n- Luke is a chef.\nSince Luke can make cookies, scrambled eggs, and muffins, but not pasta, and people who cook can make scrambled eggs and pasta, then Luke is not a chef. So, the evaluation is:\n- ANSWER: False\n\n7.\nThe premises are:\n- ETS develops various standardized tests primarily in the United States for K-12 and higher education.\n- ETS administers international tests, including the TOEFL, TOEIC, GRE, and subject tests.\n- Many of the assessments ETS develops are associated with entry to the US tertiary and quaternary education institutions.\n- ETS also develops K-12 statewide assessments used for accountability testing in many states.\nThe conclusion is:\n- ETS doesn't administer tests internationally.\nFrom the premises, we can deduce that ETS administers international tests, which contradicts the conclusion. So, the evaluation is:\n- ANSWER: False\n\n8.\nThe premises are:\n- Daveed Diggs is an actor and film producer.\n- Daveed Diggs played two roles in the musical Hamilton on Broadway.\n- One of the actors from Hamilton won the best actor award.\n- The actor playing Thomas Jefferson won the best actor award.\n- Daveed Diggs played Thomas Jefferson.\n- Musicals on Broadway are not films.\nThe conclusion is:\n- Daveed Diggs won the best actor award.\nSince Daveed Diggs played Thomas Jefferson and the actor playing Thomas Jefferson won the best actor award, we can conclude that Daveed Diggs won the best actor award.

Nothing is a good thing and also a bad thing.\n- All environment-friendly things are good.\n- A worksheet is either paper or environment-friendly.\n\nThe conclusion is: A worksheet is not biodegradable.\n\nAnalysis: \n- From premises 1 and 2, we can infer that all paper is environment-friendly.\n- From premise 3, we know that a worksheet is paper.\n- Therefore, a worksheet is environment-friendly (from premise 6).\n- From premise 5, we know that environment-friendly things are good, but premise 4 tells us that nothing is both good and bad, so a worksheet is good.\n- Since a worksheet is good and premise 1 states that all biodegradable things are environment-friendly, we can infer that a worksheet must be biodegradable.\n- Therefore, the conclusion \"A worksheet is not biodegradable\" does not follow from the premises.\n\nANSWER: ANSWER: False\n\n### Problem 2\nThe premises are:\n\n- A La Liga soccer team ranks higher than another La Liga soccer team if it receives more points.\n- If there are two La Liga soccer teams and neither has more points than the other, then the team which receives more points from the games between the two teams ranks higher.\n- Real

prison (from premise 5).\n- If James has been to prison, then he was once convicted of murder (from premise 6).\n- However, premise 4 states that everyone convicted of murder goes to prison.\n- Therefore, if James was once convicted of murder, then he must be an exception to premise 4.\n- This means that James is in prison for a reason other than murder.\n- From premise 3, we know that everyone in the army is an employee of a government department.\n- Therefore, James is in the army (from premise 3) and pays his taxes (from premise 2).\n- This means that James contributes to the

on Broadway are not films.\n\nThe conclusion is: Daveed Diggs won the best actor award.\n\nAnalysis: \n- From premise 3, we know that one of the actors from Hamilton won the best actor award.\n- From premise 5, we know that Daveed Diggs played Thomas Jefferson.\n- From premise 4, we know that the actor playing Thomas Jefferson won the best actor award.\n- Therefore, Daveed Diggs won the best actor award (from premise 4).\n- From premise 6, we know that musicals on Broadway are not films.\n- However, premise 2 states that Daveed Diggs played two roles in the musical Hamilton on Broadway.\n- Therefore, Daveed Diggs played roles in a musical, but premise 6 tells us that musicals are not films.\n- This does not provide any information about whether Daveed Diggs won the best actor award.\n\nANSWER: ANSWER: True\n\n### Problem 9\nThe premises are:\n\n- A natural language processing task can be categorized as either a language generation task or a language understanding task.\n-

If she is not a Nobel physics laureate, then she must be an Olympic gold medal winner. If she is an Olympic gold medal winner, then she is a professional athlete, which implies that she spends most of her time on sports. However, this would mean that she is both an Olympic gold medal winner and spends the most time on sports, which is a contradiction. Therefore, if Amy is not a Nobel physics laureate, she must be an Olympic gold medal winner.\n\n4. <PREMISES>\nIf a person pays their taxes, then they contribute to the country.\nEveryone who works for a government department pays a tax on their salary.\nEveryone in the army is an employee of a government department.\nEveryone convicted of murder goes to prison.\nEveryone who has been to prison has a criminal record.\nJames was either once convicted of murder, or spent time in prison.\nJames either has a criminal record, or pays his taxes.\n</PREMISES>\n<CONCLUSION>\nJames does not contribute to the country.\n</CONCLUSION>\n<EVALUATE>\nANSWER: Uncertain\n\nFrom the premises, we know that if James has a criminal record, then he has been to prison. If he has been to prison, then he has a criminal record. This creates a loop, and we cannot determine whether James has a criminal record or pays his taxes. Since we cannot determine whether James pays his taxes or not, we also cannot determine whether he contributes to the country or not.\n\n5. <PREMISES>\nNo songs are visuals.\nAll folk songs are songs.\nAll videos are visuals.\nAll movies are videos.\nAll sci-fi movies are movies.\nInception is a sci-fi movie.\nMac is neither a folk song nor a sci-fi movie.\n</PREMISES>\n<CONCLUSION>\nInception is a folk song.\n</CONCLUSION>\n<EVALUATE>\nANSWER: False\n\nFrom the premises, we know that Inception is a sci-fi movie, which is a type of movie. Since movies are videos, and videos are visuals, Inception is a visual. This directly contradicts the premise that no songs are visuals, but it does not provide any information about Inception being a folk song.\n\n6. <PREMISES>\nEvery chef can cook.\nSome people who aren\u2019t chefs can cook.\nPeople who cook can make scrambled eggs and pasta.\nIf someone can make cookies and muffins, they are a baker.\nBakers who can also make scrambled eggs can make a good breakfast.\nLuke can make cookies, scrambled eggs, and muffins, but not pasta.\n</PREMISES>\n<CONCLUSION>\nLuke is a chef.\n</CONCLUSION>\n<EVALUATE>\nANSWER: False\n\nFrom the premises, we know that Luke can make cookies, scrambled eggs, and muffins. This implies that he is a baker, but it does not imply that he is a chef. We know that bakers who can also make scrambled eggs can make a good breakfast, but this is not a sufficient condition for being a chef.\n\n7. <PREMISES>\nETS develops various standardized tests primarily in the United States for K-12 and higher education.\nETS administers international tests, including the TOEFL, TOEIC, GRE, and subject tests.\nMany of the assessments ETS develops are associated with entry to the US tertiary and quaternary education institutions.\nETS also develops K-12 statewide assessments used for accountability testing in many states.\n</PREMISES>\n<CONCLUSION>\nETS doesn't administer tests internationally.\n</CONCLUSION>\n<EVALUATE>\nANSWER: False\n\nThe premises explicitly state that ETS administers international tests, including the TOEFL, TOEIC, GRE, and subject tests. This directly contradicts the conclusion.\n\n8. <PREMISES>\nDaveed Diggs is an actor and film producer.\nDaveed Diggs played two roles in the musical Hamilton on Broadway.\nOne of the actors from Hamilton won the best actor award.\nThe actor playing Thomas Jefferson won the best actor award.\nDaveed Diggs played Thomas Jefferson.\nMusicals on Broadway are not films.\n</PREMISES>\n<CONCLUSION>\nDaveed Diggs won the best actor award.\n</CONCLUSION>\n<EVALUATE>\nANSWER: True\n\nFrom the premises, we know that Daveed Diggs played Thomas Jefferson in the musical Hamilton, and that the actor playing Thomas Jefferson won the best actor award. Therefore, Daveed Diggs won the best actor award.\n\n9. <PREMISES>\nDouglas Adams is an author who created the book collection called The Salmon of Doubt.\nThe Salmon of Doubt is about life experiences and technology.\nAll authors are writers.\nWriters create innovative ideas.\nSome books that contain innovative ideas are about technology.\n</PREMISES>\n<CONCLUSION>\nThe Salmon of Doubt has no innovative Ideas.\n</CONCLUSION>\n<EVALUATE>\nANSWER: False\n\nFrom the premises, we know that The Salmon of Doubt is about life experiences and technology, and that some books that contain innovative ideas are about technology.

The first problem:\nThe premises are:\n- All biodegradable things are environment-friendly.\n- All woodware is biodegradable.\n- All paper is woodware.\n- Nothing is a good thing and also a bad thing.\n- All environment-friendly things are good.\n- A worksheet is either paper or environment-friendly.\n\nThe conclusion is: A worksheet is not biodegradable.\n\nEvaluation:\nFrom the premises, we can infer that all paper is environment-friendly (since all woodware is biodegradable, and all paper is woodware), and all environment-friendly things are good. However, we cannot conclude that a worksheet is not biodegradable. The premises do not provide any information about worksheets being biodegradable or not. Therefore, the conclusion is uncertain.\n\n2. The second problem:\nThe premises are:\n- A La Liga soccer team ranks higher than another La Liga soccer team if it receives more points.\n- If there are two La Liga soccer teams and neither has more points than the other, then the team which receives more points from the games between the two teams ranks higher.\n- Real Madrid and Barcelona are both La Liga soccer teams.\n- Real Madrid received more points than Barcelona.\n- Neither Real Madrid nor Barcelona received more points from the games between them.\n\nThe conclusion is: Real Madrid ranks higher than Barcelona.\n\nEvaluation:\nFrom the premises, we can infer that Real Madrid ranks higher than Barcelona, because Real Madrid received more points than Barcelona, and there is no information suggesting that the points they received from their games against each other would change the ranking. Therefore, the conclusion is true.\n\n3. The third problem:\nThe premises are:\n- All professional athletes spend most of their time on sports.\n- All Olympic gold medal winners are professional athletes.\n- No full-time scientists spend the majority of their time on sports.\n- All Nobel physics laureates are full-time scientists.\n- Amy spends the most time on sports, or Amy is an Olympic gold medal winner.\n- If Amy is not a Nobel physics laureate, then Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner.\n\nThe conclusion is: If Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner, then Amy is a Nobel physics laureate.\n\nEvaluation:\nFrom the premises, we can infer that if Amy is an Olympic gold medal winner, then she must be a professional athlete, which means she cannot be a full-time scientist. Since all Nobel physics laureates are full-time scientists, Amy cannot be an Olympic gold medal winner and a Nobel physics laureate at the same time. However, this does not mean that if Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner, she must be a Nobel physics laureate. It's possible that Amy is a professional athlete who is not an Olympic gold medal winner. Therefore, the conclusion is false.\n\n4.

Since all folk songs are songs, and no songs are visuals, Inception cannot be a folk song. Therefore, the conclusion is false.\n\n6. The sixth problem:\nThe premises are:\n- Every chef can cook.\n- Some people who aren\u2019t chefs can cook.\n- People who cook can make scrambled eggs and pasta.\n- If someone can make cookies and muffins, they are a baker.\n- Bakers who can also make scrambled eggs can make a good breakfast.\n- Luke can make cookies, scrambled eggs, and muffins, but not pasta.\n\nThe conclusion is: Luke is a chef.\n\nEvaluation:\nFrom the premises, we can infer that Luke can cook (since he can make scrambled eggs and muffins), but we cannot conclude that Luke is a chef. It's possible that Luke is a baker who can cook. Therefore, the conclusion is false.\n\n7.

Since a worksheet is either paper or environment-friendly, we can conclude that a worksheet is either biodegradable or environment-friendly. However, we cannot conclude that a worksheet is not biodegradable because it could be biodegradable. Therefore, the conclusion is uncertain.\n\n2.

From premise 2, all woodware is biodegradable. By modus ponens (If A, then B; A, therefore B), we can conclude that all paper is biodegradable.\n\nFrom premise 6, a worksheet is either paper or environment-friendly. Since we've established that all paper is biodegradable, and premise 1 states that all biodegradable things are environment-friendly, we can conclude that a worksheet is environment-friendly.\n\nPremise 5 states that all environment-friendly things are good.

All environment-friendly things are good.\n6. A worksheet is either paper or environment-friendly.\n\nConclusion: A worksheet is not biodegradable.\n\nAnalysis: We can deduce that a worksheet is paper (6), and since all paper is woodware (3) and all woodware is biodegradable (2), a worksheet must be biodegradable. However, there is no direct information to support the conclusion that a worksheet is not biodegradable. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nANSWER: Uncertain\n\n2. A La Liga soccer team ranks higher than another La Liga soccer team if it receives more points.\n3. If there are two La Liga soccer teams and neither has more points than the other, then the team which receives more points from the games between the two teams ranks higher.\n4. Real Madrid and Barcelona are both La Liga soccer teams.\n5. Real Madrid received more points than Barcelona.\n6. Neither Real Madrid nor Barcelona received more points from the games between them.\n\nConclusion: Real Madrid ranks higher than Barcelona.\n\nAnalysis: We can deduce that Real Madrid received more points than Barcelona (5), so according to the first premise, Real Madrid ranks higher than Barcelona. The second premise does not apply in this case, as there is no tie in points between the two teams. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nANSWER: True\n\n3. All professional athletes spend most of their time on sports.\n4. All Olympic gold medal winners are professional athletes.\n5. No full-time scientists spend the majority of their time on sports.\n6. All Nobel physics laureates are full-time scientists.\n7. Amy spends the most time on sports, or Amy is an Olympic gold medal winner.\n8. If Amy is not a Nobel physics laureate, then Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner.\n\nConclusion: If Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner, then Amy is a Nobel physics laureate.\n\nAnalysis: We can deduce that Amy is either an Olympic gold medal winner (7) or a Nobel physics laureate (8), but not both. Since Amy cannot be both an Olympic gold medal winner and a Nobel physics laureate, and the second premise does not provide any information about Amy being a Nobel physics laureate, the conclusion is uncertain. However, based on the premises, we can deduce that Amy must be a Nobel physics laureate if she is not an Olympic gold medal winner, because the only other option (spending most time on sports) is not possible given the premises. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nANSWER: False\n\n4. If a person pays their taxes, then they contribute to the country.\n5. Everyone who works for a government department pays a tax on their salary.\n6. Everyone in the army is an employee of a government department.\n7. Everyone convicted of murder goes to prison.\n8. Everyone who has been to prison has a criminal record.\n9. James was either once convicted of murder, or spent time in prison.\n10. James either has a criminal record, or pays his taxes.\n\nConclusion: James does not contribute to the country.\n\nAnalysis: We can deduce that James has a criminal record (9 and 8), but we cannot determine whether James pays his taxes (10). Therefore, the answer is:\n\nANSWER: Uncertain\n\n5. No songs are visuals.\n6. All folk songs are songs.\n7. All videos are visuals.\n8. All movies are videos.\n9. All sci-fi movies are movies.\n10. Inception is a sci-fi movie.\n11. Mac is neither a folk song nor a sci-fi movie.\n\nConclusion: Inception is a folk song.\n\nAnalysis: We can deduce that Inception is a movie (9), and movies are not songs (5). Therefore, the answer is:\n\nANSWER: False\n\n6. Every chef can cook.\n7. Some people who aren\u2019t chefs can cook.\n8. People who cook can make scrambled eggs and pasta.\n9. If someone can make cookies and muffins, they are a baker.\n10. Bakers who can also make scrambled eggs can make a good breakfast.\n11. Luke can make cookies, scrambled eggs, and muffins, but not pasta.\n\nConclusion: Luke is a chef.\n\nAnalysis: We can deduce that Luke is not a chef, because if he were a chef, he would be able to make pasta (8), but he cannot make pasta (11). Therefore, the answer is:\n\nANSWER: False\n\n7. ETS develops various standardized tests primarily in the United States for K-12 and higher education.\n8.

ETS also develops K-12 statewide assessments used for accountability testing in many states.\n\nConclusion: ETS doesn't administer tests internationally.\n\nAnalysis: We can deduce that ETS administers international tests (8), so the conclusion is false. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nANSWER: False\n\n8. Daveed Diggs is an actor and film producer.\n9. Daveed Diggs played two roles in the musical Hamilton on Broadway.\n10.
