We want to evaluate if a worksheet is not dispensable. From premise 6, we know that a worksheet is either paper or is environment-friendly. If it is paper, then from premise 3, a worksheet is woodware, and from premise 2, a worksheet is dispensable. If it is environment-friendly, we know it is good from premise 5, but we know nothing about whether it is dispensable. Therefore, we don't know if a worksheet is dispensible or not, so the statement is uncertain.\nANSWER:\tUncertain\n</EVALUATE>\n\n---\n<PREMISES>\nA La Liga soccer team ranks higher than another if it receives more points.\nIf two La Liga soccer teams recieve the same points, the team which recieves more points from the games between the two teams ranks higher.\nReal Madrid and Barcelona are both La Liga soccer teams.\nIn La Liga 2021-2022, Real Madrid recieves 86 points and Barcelon recieves 73 points.\nIn La Liga 2021-2022, Real Madrid and Barcelona both recieve 3 points from the games between them.\n</PREMISES>\n<CONCLUSION>\nIn La Liga 2021-2022, Real Madrid ranks higher than Barcelona.\n</CONCLUSION>\n<EVALUATE>\n\nLet's think step by step. We want to evaluate if in La Liga 2021-2022, Real Madrid ranks higher than Barcelona. From premise 1, we know that a La Liga soccer team ranks higher than another if it receives more points. From premise 4, we know that in La Liga 2021-2022, Real Madrid received more points than Barcelona. Therefore, in La Liga 2021-2022, Real Madrid received more points than Barcelona, so Real Madrid ranks higher than Barcelona, so the statement is true.\nANSWER:\tTrue\n</EVALUATE>\n\n---\n<PREMISES>\nAll athletes are good at sports.\nAll Olympic gold medal winners are good athletes.\nNo scientists are good at sports.\nAll Nobel laureates are scientists.\nAmy is good at sports or Amy is an Olympic gold medal winner.\nIf Amy is not a Nobel laureate, then Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner.\n</PREMISES>\n<CONCLUSION>\nIf Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner, then Amy is a Nobel laureate.\n</CONCLUSION>\n<EVALUATE>\n\nLet's think step by step. We want to evaluate the statement \"if Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner, then Amy is a Nobel laureate\". Let's assume that Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner. This doesn't tell us anything about whether Amy is a Nobel laureate, so the statement isn't true, meaning it is either False or Uncertain. To distinguish between the two, notice that we could have a scenario where Amy is neither an Olympic gold medal winner nor a Nobel laureate. None of the premises are violated in this case. This means the statement must be false.\nANSWER:\tFalse\n</EVALUATE>\n\n---\n<PREMISES>\nAll people who are respected by others are people who contribute to the country.\nIf a person is respected by others, then he/she contributes to the country.\nAll people available to have a visit without any fees are those respected by others.\nAll Customers who once served in the army are available to have a visit without any fees.\nAll people who once were sentenced for thief stayed in prison for some time.\nAll people who once stayed in prison for some time have a bad record in the local state.\nJames was either once sentenced for thief or stayed in prison for some time.\nJames is either with a bad record in the local state or respected by others.\n</PREMISES>\n<CONCLUSION>\nJames contributes to the country.\n</CONCLUSION>\n<EVALUATE>\n\nLet's think step by step. We want to evaluate if James contributes to the country. Let's think about what we know about James. First, we know that James was either sentenced for thief or stayed in prison. However, this doesn't tell us anything about whether James contributed to the country. Second, we know that James either had a bad record in the local state or that he was respected by others. However, the premises don't tell us anything about the relationship between having a bad record and contributing to the country. Therefore, it is uncertain whether James contributes to the country.\nANSWER:\tUncertain\n</EVALUATE>\n\n---\n<PREMISES>\nNo songs are visual.\nAll folk songs are songs.\nAll videos are visual.\nAll movies are videos.\nAll sci-fi movies are movies.\nInception is a sci-fi movie.\nMac is neither a folk song nor a sci-fi movie.\n</PREMISES>\n<CONCLUSION>\nInception is a folk song.\n</CONCLUSION>\n<EVALUATE>\n\nLet's think step by step. We want to evaluate if Inception is a folk song. We know that Inception is a sci-fi movie. Since all movies are videos and Inception is a movie, it is a video, which means it is visual. On the other hand, we know that all folk songs are songs, and no songs are visual, so no folk songs are visual. Therefore, since Inception is visual but no folk songs are visual, we know that Inception cannot be a folk song, so the statement is false.\nANSWER:\tFalse\n</EVALUATE>\n\n---\n<PREMISES>\nEvery chef can cook.\nSome people who aren\u2019t chefs can cook.\nPeople who cook can make scrambled eggs and pasta.\nIf someone can make cookies and muffins, they are a baker.\nBakers who can also make scrambled eggs can make a good breakfast.\nLuke can make cookies, scrambled eggs, and muffins, but not pasta.\n</PREMISES>\n<CONCLUSION>\nLuke can make a good breakfast.\n</CONCLUSION>\n<EVALUATE>\n\nLet's think step by step. We want to evaluate if Luke can make a good breakfast. From the last premise, we know that Luke can make cookies, scrambled eggs, and muffins. Since Luke can make cookies and muffins, they are a baker. Now, combining the information we have, since Luke is a baker and can make scrambled eggs, this means that they can make a good breakfast. Therefore, Luke can make a good breakfast, so the statement is true.\nANSWER:\tTrue\n</EVALUATE>\n\n---\n<PREMISES>\nETS develops various standardized tests primarily in the United States for K-12 and higher education.\nETS administers international tests including the TOEFL, TOEIC, GRE and subject tests in more than 180 countries.\nMany of the assessments ETS develops are associated with entry to the US tertiary and quaternary education institutions.\nETS also develops K-12 statewide assessments used for accountability testing in many states.\n</PREMISES>\n<CONCLUSION>\nETS develops assessments for K-12 statewide as well as entry to US tertiary and quaternary education institutions.\n</CONCLUSION>\n<EVALUATE>\n\nLet's think step by step.

We want to evaluate if Bonnie performs in school talent shows often. From the premises, we know that if Bonnie performs in school talent shows often, then she attends and is very engaged with school events. We also know that Bonnie either attends and is very engaged with school events and is a student who attends the school, or she neither attends nor is engaged with school events nor is a student who attends the school. However, this does not tell us anything about Bonnie's participation in school talent shows. Therefore, we cannot determine if Bonnie performs in school talent shows often based on the given information, so the statement is uncertain.\nANSWER:\tUncertain\n", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate whether Bonnie performs in school talent shows often. We know from premise 3 that Bonnie either both attends and is very engaged with school events and is a student who attends the school, or she neither attends and is very engaged with school events nor is a student who attends the school. This means that Bonnie can either be a student who is engaged with school events or not. From premise 1, we know that people who perform in school talent shows often attend and are very engaged with school events. Since Bonnie is either engaged with school events or not, and people who are engaged with school events often perform in school talent shows, Bonnie may or may not perform in school talent shows often. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Bonnie performs in school talent shows often.\nANSWER:\tUncertain\n", "Let's think step by step. The conclusion we're trying to evaluate is that Bonnie performs in school talent shows often. To reach this conclusion, we must assume Bonnie both attends and is very engaged with school events, and is a student who attends the school, because it's the only way she can fulfill the conditions of the premises and still be Bonnie. Since Bonnie fulfills the conditions of the premises, it must be true that Bonnie performs in school talent shows often.\nANSWER:\tTrue\n", "Let's think step by step. We are given several premises that involve Bonnie's relationship to attending school, being engaged with school events, being a student, and chaperoning high school dances. The conclusion we're trying to evaluate is whether Bonnie performs in school talent shows often.\n\nFirst, let's consider the relationship between students and chaperoning high school dances. The premises state that if people chaperone high school dances, then they are not students who attend the school. This means that Bonnie, if she chaperones high school dances, cannot be a student who attends the school.\n\nNext, let's look at the relationship between Bonnie's engagement with school events and her student status. The premises tell us that Bonnie either both attends and is very engaged with school events and is a student who attends the school, or she neither attends and is very engaged with school events nor is a student who attends the school. This presents us with two scenarios for Bonnie:\n\n1. Bonnie attends school, is very engaged with school events, and is a student who attends the school.\n2. Bonnie does not attend school, is not engaged with school events, and is not a student who attends the school.\n\nThe conclusion we want to evaluate is whether Bonnie performs in school talent shows often. According to the premises, if people perform in school talent shows often, then they attend and are very engaged with school events. This matches with the first scenario of Bonnie's situation. Therefore, based on the given premises, Bonnie does attend school, is very engaged with school events, and is a student who attends the school, which implies that she performs in school talent shows often.\n\nAnswer: True\n", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if Bonnie performs in school talent shows often. According to premise 2, Bonnie is either very engaged with school events or disinterested in the community, and premise 3 tells us that Bonnie chaperones high school dances, which means Bonnie is disinterested in the community. Since Bonnie is disinterested in the community, she does not perform in school talent shows often, which means she does not attend and is not very engaged with school events. This means Bonnie does not meet either condition in premise 1, so Bonnie does not perform in school talent shows often.\nANSWER:\tFalse\n", "Let's think step by step. Let's evaluate if Bonnie performs in school talent shows often, given the premises.\n\n1. If people perform in school talent shows often, then they attend and are very engaged with school events. (Premise 1)\n2. People either perform in school talent shows often or are inactive and disinterested members of their community. (Premise 2)\n3. If people chaperone high school dances, then they are not students who attend the school. (Premise 3)\n4.

Bonnie either both attends and is very engaged with school events and is a student who attends the school, or she neither attends and is very engaged with school events nor is a student who attends the school. (Premise 6)\n\nFrom Premise 2, we know Bonnie either performs often (and is engaged with school events) or she is inactive and disinterested in the community. From Premise 3 and Premise 4, if Bonnie were in the inactive and disinterested community, she would chaperone high school dances, which contradicts Premise 5 since students who attend the school are active and engaged. Therefore, Bonnie must attend and be engaged with school events. This means Bonnie performs in school talent shows often.\n\nANSWER: True\n", "Let's think step by step.

Bonnie either both attends and is very engaged with school events and is a student who attends the school, or she neither attends and is very engaged with school events nor is a student who attends the school.\n\nFrom premise 6, Bonnie either both attends and is very engaged with school events and is a student who attends the school, or she neither attends and is very engaged with school events nor is a student who attends the school. If Bonnie neither attends and is very engaged with school events nor is a student who attends the school, then she must be an inactive and disinterested member of her community (from premise 2). And since all people who are inactive and disinterested members of their community chaperone high school dances (from premise 4), Bonnie would be chaperoning high school dances. However, from premise 3, if Bonnie chaperones high school dances, then she is not a student who attends the school.\n\nSo, Bonnie cannot be an inactive and disinterested member of her community, so she must be both attending and very engaged with school events, and a student who attends the school (from premise 6).

We want to evaluate if Bonnie performs in school talent shows often. Let's break down the premises:\n1. If people perform in school talent shows often, then they attend and are very engaged with school events.\n2. People either perform in school talent shows often or are inactive and disinterested members of their community.\n3. If people chaperone high school dances, then they are not students who attend the school.\n4. All people who are inactive and disinterested members of their community chaperone high school dances.\n5. All young children and teenagers who wish to further their academic careers and educational opportunities are students who attend the school.\n6. Bonnie either both attends and is very engaged with school events and is a student who attends the school, or she neither attends and is very engaged with school events nor is a student who attends the school.\n\nFrom premise 2, we know that Bonnie either performs in school talent shows often or is inactive and disinterested in the community. Let's consider each case separately:\n\nCase 1: Bonnie performs in school talent shows often.\n- According to premise 1, if Bonnie performs in school talent shows often, then she attends and is very engaged with school events.\n- From premise 6, if Bonnie attends and is very engaged with school events, then she is a student who attends the school.\n- This means Bonnie performs in school talent shows often and is a student who attends the school, which satisfies case 1.\n\nCase 2: Bonnie is inactive and disinterested in the community.\n- According to premise 4, all people who are inactive and disinterested in the community chaperone high school dances.\n- According to premise 3, if Bonnie chaperones high school dances, then she is not a student who attends the school.\n- From premise 5, all young children and teenagers who wish to further their academic careers and educational opportunities are students who attend the school.\n- Since Bonnie is not a student who attends the school, she cannot be a young child or teenager who wishes to further their academic careers and educational opportunities.\n- From premise 6, if Bonnie is neither attending school nor a student, then she performs in school talent shows often.\n\nTherefore, in either case (whether Bonnie is performing in school talent shows often or not), we can conclude that Bonnie performs in school talent shows often. The conclusion follows from the premises.\n\nANSWER: True\n", "Let's think step by step. Let's first break down the premises and see if we can deduce the conclusion:\n\nPremise 1: If people perform in school talent shows often, then they attend and are very engaged with school events.\nPremise 2: People either perform in school talent shows often or are inactive and disinterested members of their community.\nPremise 3: If people chaperone high school dances, then they are not students who attend the school.\nPremise 4: All people who are inactive and disinterested members of their community chaperone high school dances.\nPremise 5: All young children and teenagers who wish to further their academic careers and educational opportunities are students who attend the school.\nPremise 6: Bonnie either both attends and is very engaged with school events and is a student who attends the school, or she neither attends and is very engaged with school events nor is a student who attends the school.\n\nNow, let's try to deduce the conclusion that Bonnie performs in school talent shows often.\n\nFrom Premise 1, we know that performing in school talent shows often implies that Bonnie attends and is very engaged with school events. Premise 2 tells us that Bonnie either performs in school talent shows often or is an inactive and disinterested member of her community. Premise 3 and Premise 4 together imply that if Bonnie is an inactive and disinterested member of her community, then she cannot be a student who attends the school. Premise 5 implies that Bonnie, being a young child or teenager wishing to further her academic career, must be a student who attends the school.\n\nNow, considering Premise 6, Bonnie has two possibilities: she both attends and is very engaged with school events (which could include performing in school talent shows often) and is a student who attends the school, or she neither attends nor is engaged with school events and is not a student who attends the school.\n\nSince Bonnie must be a student who attends the school based on Premise 5, she cannot be an inactive and disinterested member of her community, and therefore she must be both attending and engaged with school events. This aligns with Premise 6, where Bonnie both attends and is engaged with school events. Given that she is engaged with school events, it is possible that she performs in school talent shows often, but we cannot definitively conclude that Bonnie performs in school talent shows often without more information.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion that Bonnie performs in school talent shows often is not necessarily true based on the given premises. We can only say that it is a possibility, but not a certainty.\n\nANSWER:\tUncertain\n"], "answers": ["Uncertain", "Uncertain", "True", "True", "False", "True", "True", "Error", "True", "Uncertain"], "reference": "Uncertain", "time_total": 132.48809695243835, "time_llm": 132.48416829109192, "prompt_length": 9148}

We want to evaluate if a worksheet is not dispensable. From premise 6, we know that a worksheet is either paper or is environment-friendly. If it is paper, then from premise 3, a worksheet is woodware, and from premise 2, a worksheet is dispensable. If it is environment-friendly, we know it is good from premise 5, but we know nothing about whether it is dispensable. Therefore, we don't know if a worksheet is dispensible or not, so the statement is uncertain.\nANSWER:\tUncertain\n</EVALUATE>\n\n---\n<PREMISES>\nA La Liga soccer team ranks higher than another if it receives more points.\nIf two La Liga soccer teams recieve the same points, the team which recieves more points from the games between the two teams ranks higher.\nReal Madrid and Barcelona are both La Liga soccer teams.\nIn La Liga 2021-2022, Real Madrid recieves 86 points and Barcelon recieves 73 points.\nIn La Liga 2021-2022, Real Madrid and Barcelona both recieve 3 points from the games between them.\n</PREMISES>\n<CONCLUSION>\nIn La Liga 2021-2022, Real Madrid ranks higher than Barcelona.\n</CONCLUSION>\n<EVALUATE>\n\nLet's think step by step. We want to evaluate if in La Liga 2021-2022, Real Madrid ranks higher than Barcelona. From premise 1, we know that a La Liga soccer team ranks higher than another if it receives more points. From premise 4, we know that in La Liga 2021-2022, Real Madrid received more points than Barcelona. Therefore, in La Liga 2021-2022, Real Madrid received more points than Barcelona, so Real Madrid ranks higher than Barcelona, so the statement is true.\nANSWER:\tTrue\n</EVALUATE>\n\n---\n<PREMISES>\nAll athletes are good at sports.\nAll Olympic gold medal winners are good athletes.\nNo scientists are good at sports.\nAll Nobel laureates are scientists.\nAmy is good at sports or Amy is an Olympic gold medal winner.\nIf Amy is not a Nobel laureate, then Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner.\n</PREMISES>\n<CONCLUSION>\nIf Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner, then Amy is a Nobel laureate.\n</CONCLUSION>\n<EVALUATE>\n\nLet's think step by step. We want to evaluate the statement \"if Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner, then Amy is a Nobel laureate\". Let's assume that Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner. This doesn't tell us anything about whether Amy is a Nobel laureate, so the statement isn't true, meaning it is either False or Uncertain. To distinguish between the two, notice that we could have a scenario where Amy is neither an Olympic gold medal winner nor a Nobel laureate. None of the premises are violated in this case. This means the statement must be false.\nANSWER:\tFalse\n</EVALUATE>\n\n---\n<PREMISES>\nAll people who are respected by others are people who contribute to the country.\nIf a person is respected by others, then he/she contributes to the country.\nAll people available to have a visit without any fees are those respected by others.\nAll Customers who once served in the army are available to have a visit without any fees.\nAll people who once were sentenced for thief stayed in prison for some time.\nAll people who once stayed in prison for some time have a bad record in the local state.\nJames was either once sentenced for thief or stayed in prison for some time.\nJames is either with a bad record in the local state or respected by others.\n</PREMISES>\n<CONCLUSION>\nJames contributes to the country.\n</CONCLUSION>\n<EVALUATE>\n\nLet's think step by step. We want to evaluate if James contributes to the country. Let's think about what we know about James. First, we know that James was either sentenced for thief or stayed in prison. However, this doesn't tell us anything about whether James contributed to the country. Second, we know that James either had a bad record in the local state or that he was respected by others. However, the premises don't tell us anything about the relationship between having a bad record and contributing to the country. Therefore, it is uncertain whether James contributes to the country.\nANSWER:\tUncertain\n</EVALUATE>\n\n---\n<PREMISES>\nNo songs are visual.\nAll folk songs are songs.\nAll videos are visual.\nAll movies are videos.\nAll sci-fi movies are movies.\nInception is a sci-fi movie.\nMac is neither a folk song nor a sci-fi movie.\n</PREMISES>\n<CONCLUSION>\nInception is a folk song.\n</CONCLUSION>\n<EVALUATE>\n\nLet's think step by step. We want to evaluate if Inception is a folk song. We know that Inception is a sci-fi movie. Since all movies are videos and Inception is a movie, it is a video, which means it is visual. On the other hand, we know that all folk songs are songs, and no songs are visual, so no folk songs are visual. Therefore, since Inception is visual but no folk songs are visual, we know that Inception cannot be a folk song, so the statement is false.\nANSWER:\tFalse\n</EVALUATE>\n\n---\n<PREMISES>\nEvery chef can cook.\nSome people who aren\u2019t chefs can cook.\nPeople who cook can make scrambled eggs and pasta.\nIf someone can make cookies and muffins, they are a baker.\nBakers who can also make scrambled eggs can make a good breakfast.\nLuke can make cookies, scrambled eggs, and muffins, but not pasta.\n</PREMISES>\n<CONCLUSION>\nLuke can make a good breakfast.\n</CONCLUSION>\n<EVALUATE>\n\nLet's think step by step. We want to evaluate if Luke can make a good breakfast. From the last premise, we know that Luke can make cookies, scrambled eggs, and muffins. Since Luke can make cookies and muffins, they are a baker. Now, combining the information we have, since Luke is a baker and can make scrambled eggs, this means that they can make a good breakfast. Therefore, Luke can make a good breakfast, so the statement is true.\nANSWER:\tTrue\n</EVALUATE>\n\n---\n<PREMISES>\nETS develops various standardized tests primarily in the United States for K-12 and higher education.\nETS administers international tests including the TOEFL, TOEIC, GRE and subject tests in more than 180 countries.\nMany of the assessments ETS develops are associated with entry to the US tertiary and quaternary education institutions.\nETS also develops K-12 statewide assessments used for accountability testing in many states.\n</PREMISES>\n<CONCLUSION>\nETS develops assessments for K-12 statewide as well as entry to US tertiary and quaternary education institutions.\n</CONCLUSION>\n<EVALUATE>\n\nLet's think step by step. We want to evaluate if ETS develops assessments for K-12 statewide as well as entry to US tertiary and quaternary educatiand doon institutions. We know that ETS develops assessments for K-12 statewide. We also know that ETS develops assessments associated with entry to the US tertiary and quaternary education institutes. Therefore, both parts of the conclusion are true, and the statement is true.\nANSWER:\tTrue\n</EVALUATE>\n\n---\n<PREMISES>\nChina is one of BRICS and its economy is emerging.\nIndia is one of BRICS and its economy is emerging.\nAll people from China speak Chinese.\nAll people from India speak Hindi or English.\nThere is an Indian.\n</PREMISES>\n<CONCLUSION>\nThere is a person from BRICS speaking Hindi.\n</CONCLUSION>\n<EVALUATE>\n\nLet's think step by step. We want to evaluate if there is a person from BRICS speaking Hindi. We know that there is an Indian, and since India is one of BRICS, we know that there is an Indian in BRICS. Furthermore, we know that they speak either Hindi or English, however, we don't know which one. Therefore, there could be a person in BRICS speaking Hindi, or there could not. Therefore, it is uncertain whether there is a person from BRICS speaking Hindi.\nANSWER:\tUncertain\n</EVALUATE>\n\n---\n\n<PREMISES>\nIf people perform in school talent shows often, then they attend and are very engaged with school events.\nPeople either perform in school talent shows often or are inactive and disinterested members of their community.\nIf people chaperone high school dances, then they are not students who attend the school.\nAll people who are inactive and disinterested members of their community chaperone high school dances.\nAll young children and teenagers who wish to further their academic careers and educational opportunities are students who attend the school.\nBonnie either both attends and is very engaged with school events and is a student who attends the school, or she neither attends and is very engaged with school events nor is a student who attends the school.\n</PREMISES>\n<CONCLUSION>\nIf Bonnie is either both a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities and chaperones high school dances or neither is a young child nor teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities, then Bonnie is either a student who attends the school or is an inactive and disinterested member of the community.\n</CONCLUSION>\n<EVALUATE>\n", "raw_generations": ["Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate the conclusion given the premises.\n\nPremise 1: If people perform in school talent shows often, then they attend and are very engaged with school events.\nPremise 2: People either perform in school talent shows often or are inactive and disinterested members of their community.\nPremise 3: If people chaperone high school dances, then they are not students who attend the school.\nPremise 4: All people who are inactive and disinterested members of their community chaperone high school dances.\nPremise 5: All young children and teenagers who wish to further their academic careers and educational opportunities are students who attend the school.\nPremise 6: Bonnie either both attends and is very engaged with school events and is a student who attends the school, or she neither attends and is very engaged with school events nor is a student who attends the school.\n\nWe can derive from Premise 2 and Premise 4 that all people who are inactive and disinterested members of their community are chaperones of high school dances. From Premise 3, we know that chaperoning high school dances means they are not students who attend the school. From Premise 1, we know that people who attend and are very engaged with school events are likely to perform in school talent shows often.\n\nPremise 6 tells us that Bonnie is either both a student who attends the school and very engaged with school events or neither of these. If Bonnie is a student who attends the school and very engaged, she likely attends school talent shows often, which is consistent with Premise 1. If Bonnie is not a student who attends the school, she is not a student who attends the school, and according to Premise 4, she must be an inactive and disinterested member of the community, which is consistent with Premise 2.\n\nNow let's evaluate the conclusion:\n\n\"If Bonnie is either both a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities and chaperones high school dances or neither is a young child nor teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities, then Bonnie is either a student who attends the school or is an inactive and disinterested member of the community.\"\n\nPremise 5 tells us that Bonnie, as a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career, is a student who attends the school. If Bonnie is a student who attends the school, she attends school events and is very engaged, which aligns with Premise 1.\n\nIf Bonnie is not a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career, then, according to Premise 6, she is not both a student who attends the school and very engaged with school events. This means Bonnie must be an inactive and disinterested member of the community, which aligns with Premise 4 and Premise 2.\n\nIn both cases, Bonnie is either a student who attends the school or an inactive and disinterested member of the community. Therefore, the conclusion is true based on the given premises.\n\nANSWER: True\n", "Let\u2019s think through this step by step.\n\nPremise 1 states that if people perform in school talent shows often, then they attend and are very engaged with school events.\n\nPremise 2 states that people either perform in school talent shows often or are inactive and disinterested members of their community.\n\nPremise 3 states that if people chaperone high school dances, then they are not students who attend the school.\n\nPremise 4 states that all people who are inactive and disinterested members of their community chaperone high school dances.\n\nPremise 5 states that all young children and teenagers who wish to further their academic careers and educational opportunities are students who attend the school.\n\nPremise 6 states that Bonnie either both attends and is very engaged with school events and is a student who attends the school, or she neither attends and is very engaged with school events nor is a student who attends the school.\n\nPremise 7 states that if Bonnie is either both a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities and chaperones high school dances, then Bonnie is either a student who attends the school or is an inactive and disinterested member of the community.\n\nPremise 8 states that if Bonnie is neither a young child nor teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities, then Bonnie is either a student who attends the school or is an inactive and disinterested member of the community.\n\nWe need to evaluate the conclusion: If Bonnie is either both a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities and chaperones high school dances, then Bonnie is either a student who attends the school or is an inactive and disinterested member of the community.\n\nBy examining the premises, we can see that:\n\n- From Premise 4, we know that all people who are inactive and disinterested members of their community chaperone high school dances.\n- From Premise 3, we know that if people chaperone high school dances, then they are not students who attend the school.\n- From Premise 7, we know that if Bonnie is either both a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities and chaperones high school dances, then Bonnie is either a student who attends the school or is an inactive and disinterested member of the community.\n\nThus, the conclusion follows directly from the given premises, and it is true.\n\nANSWER: True\n", "Let's think step by step.

often, then they attend and are very engaged with school events. Premise 2 tells us that people either perform in school talent shows often or are inactive and disinterested members of their community. From these two premises, we can deduce that if Bonnie is very engaged with school events and attends school, then she must have performed in school talent shows often. If Bonnie is not very engaged with school events or does not attend school, then she is an inactive and disinterested member of her community. From this, we can deduce that if Bonnie is not a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities, then she is an inactive and disinterested member of the community. Premise 3 tells us that all people who chaperone high school dances are not students who attend the school. Premise 4 tells us that all young children and teenagers who wish to further their academic careers and educational opportunities are students who attend the school. From these two premises, we can deduce that if Bonnie is a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities, then she is a student who attends the school. From these two premises, we can deduce that if Bonnie is both a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities and chaperones high school dances, then she is an inactive and disinterested member of the community. From these two premises, we can deduce that Bonnie either both attends and is very engaged with school events and is a student who attends the school, or she neither attends and is very engaged with school events nor is a student who attends the school. The conclusion then follows that if Bonnie is either both a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities and chaperones high school dances or neither is a young child nor teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities, then Bonnie is either a student who attends the school or is an inactive and disinterested member of the community.\n\nANSWER:\tTrue\n", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if Bonnie is either a student who attends the school or an inactive and disinterested member of the community given that Bonnie is either a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities and chaperones high school dances, or neither is a young child nor teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities.\n\nFrom premise 4, we know that all young children and teenagers who wish to further their academic careers and educational opportunities are students who attend the school. Therefore, if Bonnie is a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities, Bonnie is a student who attends the school.\n\nFrom premise 3, we know that all people who are inactive and disinterested members of their community chaperone high school dances. Therefore, if Bonnie is inactive and disinterested in her community, she chaperones high school dances.\n\nFrom premise 2, we know that people either perform in school talent shows often or are inactive and disinterested members of their community. Therefore, Bonnie could either be a student who attends the school (if she wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities) or an inactive and disinterested member of the community (if she chaperones high school dances).\n\nCombining this information, if Bonnie is either a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities and chaperones high school dances, Bonnie is either a student who attends the school or an inactive and disinterested member of the community.\n\nTherefore, the statement is true.\nANSWER: True\n", " \nLet's think step by step. We want to evaluate the conclusion if Bonnie is either a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities and chaperones high school dances or neither is a young child nor teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities, then Bonnie is either a student who attends the school or is an inactive and disinterested member of the community.\n\nPremise 1: If people perform in school talent shows often, then they attend and are very engaged with school events.\n\nPremise 2: People either perform in school talent shows often or are inactive and disinterested members of their community.\n\nPremise 3: If people chaperone high school dances, then they are not students who attend the school.\n\nPremise 4: All people who are inactive and disinterested members of their community chaperone high school dances.\n\nPremise 5: All young children and teenagers who wish to further their academic careers and educational opportunities are students who attend the school.\n\nPremise 6: Bonnie either both attends and is very engaged with school events and is a student who attends the school, or she neither attends and is very engaged with school events nor is a student who attends the school.\n\nFirst, let's consider the case where Bonnie is both a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities and chaperones high school dances. From premise 4, we know that all people who are inactive and disinterested members of their community chaperone high school dances. This means that if Bonnie is both a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities and chaperones high school dances, she must also be an inactive and disinterested member of the community. From premise 3, we know that if Bonnie is chaperoning high school dances, then she is not a student who attends the school. Therefore, if Bonnie is both a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities and chaperones high school dances, she must be an inactive and disinterested member of the community, which means the conclusion is true in this case.\n\nNext, let's consider the case where Bonnie is neither a young child nor teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities, nor is an inactive and disinterested member of the community. This means that Bonnie must not be a student who attends the school. From premise 6, we know that Bonnie is either both a student who attends the school and is very engaged with school events, or neither is a student who attends the school and is not very engaged with school events. Since Bonnie is not a student who attends the school, she must be neither a student who attends the school nor very engaged with school events. Therefore, the conclusion is true in this case as well.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is true given the premises.\nANSWER: True\n", "Let's break down the premises and the conclusion step by step:\n\nPremise 1: If people perform in school talent shows often, then they attend and are very engaged with school events.\nPremise 2: People either perform in school talent shows often or are inactive and disinterested members of their community.\nPremise 3: If people chaperone high school dances, then they are not students who attend the school.\nPremise 4: All people who are inactive and disinterested members of their community chaperone high school dances.\nPremise 5: All young children and teenagers who wish to further their academic careers and educational opportunities are students who attend the school.\nPremise 6: Bonnie either both attends and is very engaged with school events and is a student who attends the school, or she neither attends and is very engaged with school events nor is a student who attends the school.\n\nConclusion: If Bonnie is either both a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities and chaperones high school dances or neither is a young child nor teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities, then Bonnie is either a student who attends the school or is an inactive and disinterested member of the community.\n\nLet's analyze this step by step.\n\n1. Bonnie can either be both a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities and chaperones high school dances, or she can be neither a young child nor teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities.\n\n2. From Premise 4, we know that all people who are inactive and disinterested members of their community chaperone high school dances. So, if Bonnie is an inactive and disinterested member of the community, she will chaperone high school dances.\n\n3. From Premise 5, we know that all young children and teenagers who wish to further their academic careers and educational opportunities are students who attend the school. So, if Bonnie is a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities, she will attend the school.\n\n4. Premise 3 states that if people chaperone high school dances, then they are not students who attend the school. So, if Bonnie chaperones high school dances, she is not a student who attends the school.\n\n5. Premise 1 states that if people perform in school talent shows often, then they attend and are very engaged with school events. However, this premise is not directly relevant to Bonnie's case.\n\n6. Premise 6 states that Bonnie either both attends and is very engaged with school events and is a student who attends the school, or she neither attends and is very engaged with school events nor is a student who attends the school. This premise is also not directly relevant to Bonnie's case.\n\n7. Combining the above points, we can conclude that Bonnie is either a student who attends the school or an inactive and disinterested member of the community. Therefore, the conclusion is true.\n\nANSWER: True\n", "Let's think step by step. Let's break down the premises and the conclusion to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\nPremise 1: If people perform in school talent shows often, then they attend and are very engaged with school events.\nPremise 2: People either perform in school talent shows often or are inactive and disinterested members of their community.\nPremise 3: If people chaperone high school dances, then they are not students who attend the school.\nPremise 4: All people who are inactive and disinterested members of their community chaperone high school dances.\nPremise 5: All young children and teenagers who wish to further their academic careers and educational opportunities are students who attend the school.\nPremise 6: Bonnie either both attends and is very engaged with school events and is a student who attends the school, or she neither attends and is very engaged with school events nor is a student who attends the school.\n\nConclusion: If Bonnie is either both a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities and chaperones high school dances or neither is a young child nor teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities, then Bonnie is either a student who attends the school or is an inactive and disinterested member of the community.\n\nTo evaluate the conclusion, let's consider the two possible scenarios for Bonnie:\n\nScenario 1: Bonnie is both a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities and chaperones high school dances.\n- From Premise 5, Bonnie is a student who attends the school.\n- From Premise 3 and Premise 4, Bonnie cannot chaperone high school dances if she is a student who attends the school. This contradicts the first part of the scenario.\n\nScenario 2: Bonnie is neither a young child nor teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities nor chaperones high school dances.\n- From Premise 5, Bonnie is not a student who attends the school.\n- From Premise 2, Bonnie is an inactive and disinterested member of the community.\n- From Premise 4, if Bonnie is an inactive and disinterested member of the community, she chaperones high school dances.\n\nIn both scenarios, Bonnie is either a student who attends the school or an inactive and disinterested member of the community, which matches the conclusion.

We can break down the problem by considering the various conditions provided in the premises and the conclusion.\n\n1. If Bonnie is both a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities, then:\n   - She attends school.\n   - She is a student who attends the school.\n   - She is not both an inactive and disinterested member of the community and a student who attends the school.\n\n2.

We want to evaluate if a worksheet is not dispensable. From premise 6, we know that a worksheet is either paper or is environment-friendly. If it is paper, then from premise 3, a worksheet is woodware, and from premise 2, a worksheet is dispensable. If it is environment-friendly, we know it is good from premise 5, but we know nothing about whether it is dispensable.

From premise 4, we know that in La Liga 2021-2022, Real Madrid received more points than Barcelona. Therefore, in La Liga 2021-2022, Real Madrid received more points than Barcelona, so Real Madrid ranks higher than Barcelona, so the statement is true.\nANSWER:\tTrue\n</EVALUATE>\n\n---\n<PREMISES>\nAll athletes are good at sports.\nAll Olympic gold medal winners are good athletes.\nNo scientists are good at sports.\nAll Nobel laureates are scientists.\nAmy is good at sports or Amy is an Olympic gold medal winner.\nIf Amy is not a Nobel laureate, then Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner.\n</PREMISES>\n<CONCLUSION>\nIf Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner, then Amy is a Nobel laureate.\n</CONCLUSION>\n<EVALUATE>\n\nLet's think step by step. We want to evaluate the statement \"if Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner, then Amy is a Nobel laureate\". Let's assume that Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner. This doesn't tell us anything about whether Amy is a Nobel laureate, so the statement isn't true, meaning it is either False or Uncertain. To distinguish between the two, notice that we could have a scenario where Amy is neither an Olympic gold medal winner nor a Nobel laureate. None of the premises are violated in this case.

We want to evaluate if James contributes to the country. Let's think about what we know about James. First, we know that James was either sentenced for thief or stayed in prison. However, this doesn't tell us anything about whether James contributed to the country. Second, we know that James either had a bad record in the local state or that he was respected by others. However, the premises don't tell us anything about the relationship between having a bad record and contributing to the country.

We want to evaluate if Inception is a folk song. We know that Inception is a sci-fi movie. Since all movies are videos and Inception is a movie, it is a video, which means it is visual. On the other hand, we know that all folk songs are songs, and no songs are visual, so no folk songs are visual. Therefore, since Inception is visual but no folk songs are visual, we know that Inception cannot be a folk song, so the statement is false.\nANSWER:\tFalse\n</EVALUATE>\n\n---\n<PREMISES>\nEvery chef can cook.\nSome people who aren\u2019t chefs can cook.\nPeople who cook can make scrambled eggs and pasta.\nIf someone can make cookies and muffins, they are a baker.\nBakers who can also make scrambled eggs can make a good breakfast.\nLuke can make cookies, scrambled eggs, and muffins, but not pasta.\n</PREMISES>\n<CONCLUSION>\nLuke can make a good breakfast.\n</CONCLUSION>\n<EVALUATE>\n\nLet's think step by step.

The answer is:\nANSWER: True\n", "Let's think step by step.\n\nPremise 1: If people perform in school talent shows often, then they attend and are very engaged with school events.\n\nPremise 2: People either perform in school talent shows often or are inactive and disinterested members of their community.\n\nPremise 3: If people chaperone high school dances, then they are not students who attend the school.\n\nPremise 4: All people who are inactive and disinterested members of their community chaperone high school dances.\n\nPremise 5: All young children and teenagers who wish to further their academic careers and educational opportunities are students who attend the school.\n\nPremise 6: Bonnie either both attends and is very engaged with school events and is a student who attends the school, or she neither attends and is very engaged with school events nor is a student who attends the school.\n\nConclusion: If Bonnie either chaperones high school dances or, if she does not, she performs in school talent shows often, then Bonnie is both a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities and an inactive and disinterested member of the community.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the conclusion:\n\n\"If Bonnie either chaperones high school dances or, if she does not, she performs in school talent shows often, then Bonnie is both a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities and an inactive and disinterested member of the community.\"\n\nThis conclusion implies two scenarios:\n\n1. Bonnie chaperones high school dances.\n2. Bonnie performs in school talent shows often.\n\nFor Bonnie to chaperone high school dances, according to Premise 3, she must not be a student who attends the school. However, according to Premise 5, young children and teenagers who wish to further their academic careers and educational opportunities are students who attend the school. This creates a contradiction because Bonnie cannot be both chaperoning high school dances and a student who attends the school at the same time.\n\nFor Bonnie to perform in school talent shows often, according to Premise 1, she must attend and be very engaged with school events. However, according to Premise 2, people who are inactive and disinterested members of their community do not perform in school talent shows often. This creates another contradiction because Bonnie cannot be both performing in school talent shows often and an inactive and disinterested member of the community.\n\nGiven these contradictions, the conclusion \"If Bonnie either chaperones high school dances or, if she does not, she performs in school talent shows often, then Bonnie is both a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities and an inactive and disinterested member of the community\" cannot be true.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\nANSWER: False", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if Bonnie either chaperones high school dances or, if she does not, she performs in school talent shows often, then Bonnie is both a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities and an inactive and disinterested member of the community. From the premises, we know that Bonnie either both attends and is very engaged with school events and is a student who attends the school, or she neither attends and is very engaged with school events nor is a student who attends the school. If Bonnie is a student who attends the school, she attends and is very engaged with school events. Also, from premise 3, we know that all young children and teenagers who wish to further their academic careers and educational opportunities are students who attend the school. Therefore, if Bonnie is a student who attends the school, she is a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities. Also from premise 2, we know that all people who are inactive and disinterested members of their community chaperone high school dances. Therefore, if Bonnie is an inactive and disinterested member of the community, she chaperones high school dances. Combining these two facts, we have shown that if Bonnie either chaperones high school dances or, if she does not, she performs in school talent shows often, then Bonnie is both a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities and an inactive and disinterested member of the community. Therefore, the statement is true.\nANSWER:\tTrue\n", "Let's think step by step.\n\n1. The premise states that if Bonnie performs in school talent shows often, then she attends and is very engaged with school events. This means that Bonnie's performing in school talent shows often is associated with her being engaged with school events.\n\n2. The premise also states that Bonnie either attends and is engaged with school events or she is inactive and disinterested in her community. This means that Bonnie's not attending school or being disengaged is associated with her being inactive and disinterested in her community.\n\n3. The premise also states that if Bonnie chaperones high school dances, then she is not a student who attends the school. This means that Bonnie's chaperoning high school dances is associated with her not being a student who attends the school.\n\n4. The premise also states that all young children and teenagers who wish to further their academic careers and educational opportunities are students who attend the school. This means that being a student who attends the school is associated with wishing to further one's academic career and educational opportunities.\n\n5. The premise also states that Bonnie either both attends school and is engaged with school events and is a student who attends the school, or she neither attends school nor is engaged with school events nor is a student who attends the school. This means that Bonnie's attending school and being engaged with school events and being a student who attends the school are all associated.\n\n6. The conclusion states that if Bonnie either chaperones high school dances or, if she does not, she performs in school talent shows often, then Bonnie is both a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities and an inactive and disinterested member of the community. This means that Bonnie's chaperoning high school dances or performing in school talent shows often and Bonnie being a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities and being an inactive and disinterested member of the community are all associated.\n\n7. From the premises, we can see that Bonnie's chaperoning high school dances is associated with her not being a student who attends the school, which contradicts the conclusion's association of Bonnie being a student who attends the school.

All young children and teenagers who wish to further their academic careers and educational opportunities are students who attend the school.\n\nFrom premise 1, we know that Bonnie is not a student who attends the school if she chaperones high school dances.\n\nFrom premise 2, we know that Bonnie is an inactive and disinterested member of the community if she chaperones high school dances.\n\nFrom premise 3, we know that Bonnie is a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities if she is a student who attends the school.\n\nNow let's consider the conclusion:\n\nIf Bonnie either chaperones high school dances or performs in school talent shows often, then Bonnie is both a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities and an inactive and disinterested member of the community.\n\nFrom what we know, if Bonnie chaperones high school dances, then she is both a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities and an inactive and disinterested member of the community. However, we don't have any information that links Bonnie performing in school talent shows often to her being a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities or to her being an inactive and disinterested member of the community.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion cannot be determined to be true based on the given premises. It is uncertain.\nANSWER:\tUncertain\n", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate the conclusion that \"If Bonnie either chaperones high school dances or, if she does not, she performs in school talent shows often, then Bonnie is both a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities and an inactive and disinterested member of the community.\" The given premises can be broken down as follows:\n\n1. If people perform in school talent shows often, then they attend and are very engaged with school events.\n2. People either perform in school talent shows often or are inactive and disinterested members of their community.\n3. If people chaperone high school dances, then they are not students who attend the school.\n4. All people who are inactive and disinterested members of their community chaperone high school dances.\n5. All young children and teenagers who wish to further their academic careers and educational opportunities are students who attend the school.\n6. Bonnie either both attends and is very engaged with school events and is a student who attends the school, or she neither attends and is very engaged with school events nor is a student who attends the school.\n\nFrom these premises, we can deduce the following:\n- If Bonnie chaperones high school dances (Premise 3), she is not a student who attends the school (Premise 4). She is also inactive and disinterested (Premise 2). Therefore, she satisfies the condition of being both a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities (Premise 5) and an inactive and disinterested member of the community (Premise 4).\n- If Bonnie performs in school talent shows often (Premise 1), she is engaged with school events (Premise 1). This implies that Bonnie is either a student who attends the school (Premise 5) or an inactive and disinterested member of the community (Premise 2). However, if Bonnie is a student who attends the school (Premise 5), she would not be inactive and disinterested (Premise 4). Thus, Bonnie must be an inactive and disinterested member of the community.\n\nTherefore, regardless of whether Bonnie chaperones high school dances or performs in school talent shows often, Bonnie must be both a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities and an inactive and disinterested member of the community. Hence, the conclusion is true.\nANSWER: True\n", "Let's think step by step. First, if Bonnie either chaperones high school dances or, if she does not, she performs in school talent shows often, then Bonnie is either chaperoning dances or attending school events often. Now, let's evaluate the conclusion. The conclusion states that Bonnie is both a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities and an inactive and disinterested member of the community. The premises do not provide any information about Bonnie's age or academic aspirations. However, the premises do tell us that all people who chaperone high school dances are inactive and disinterested members of their community. If Bonnie is chaperoning dances, then she is indeed an inactive and disinterested member of the community. But we don't know if Bonnie is a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities, so the conclusion is uncertain.\nANSWER:\tUncertain\n", "Let's think step by step.\n\n1. The premise says that Bonnie either both attends and is very engaged with school events and is a student who attends the school, or she neither attends and is very engaged with school events nor is a student who attends the school. This means Bonnie is either a student who attends school (and is very engaged with school events) or neither a student who attends school nor engaged with school events.\n\n2. The premise also says that all people who are inactive and disinterested members of their community chaperone high school dances. This means Bonnie, if she is neither a student who attends school nor engaged with school events, is an inactive and disinterested member of the community.\n\n3. The premise says Bonnie either chaperones high school dances or, if she does not, she performs in school talent shows often. If Bonnie is an inactive and disinterested member of the community, as per step 2, she must chaperone high school dances. Therefore, Bonnie does not perform in school talent shows often.\n\n4. The conclusion says Bonnie is both a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities and an inactive and disinterested member of the community. This can be true if Bonnie is a student who attends the school (and is very engaged with school events), but we have already established from step 1 that Bonnie is neither a student who attends school nor engaged with school events. Therefore, Bonnie cannot be both a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities and an inactive and disinterested member of the community.\n\nSo, the conclusion is false.\nANSWER:\tFalse\n", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate the conclusion given the premises. The conclusion states that if Bonnie either chaperones high school dances or, if she does not, she performs in school talent shows often, then Bonnie is both a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities and an inactive and disinterested member of the community.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the given premises:\n\n1. If people perform in school talent shows often, then they attend and are very engaged with school events.\n\n2. People either perform in school talent shows often or are inactive and disinterested members of their community.\n\n3. If people chaperone high school dances, then they are not students who attend the school.\n\n4. All people who are inactive and disinterested members of their community chaperone high school dances.\n\n5. All young children and teenagers who wish to further their academic careers and educational opportunities are students who attend the school.\n\n6. Bonnie either both attends and is very engaged with school events and is a student who attends the school, or she neither attends and is very engaged with school events nor is a student who attends the school.\n\nNow, let's break down the conclusion and see if it follows from the premises:\n\n- If Bonnie either chaperones high school dances or, if she does not, she performs in school talent shows often, then Bonnie is both a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities and an inactive and disinterested member of the community.\n\nLet's analyze this statement:\n\n- Bonnie either chaperones high school dances or performs in school talent shows often.\n- If Bonnie chaperones high school dances, then by premise 3, she is not a student who attends the school.\n- If Bonnie performs in school talent shows often, then by premise 1, she attends and is very engaged with school events and is a student who attends the school.\n- If Bonnie performs in school talent shows often, then by premise 2, she is not an inactive and disinterested member of the community.\n- Therefore, if Bonnie performs in school talent shows often, she cannot be an inactive and disinterested member of the community.\n- If Bonnie is an inactive and disinterested member of the community, then by premise 4, she chaperones high school dances.\n\nNow, let's consider the second part of the conclusion:\n\n- Bonnie is both a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities and an inactive and disinterested member of the community.\n\nThis part of the conclusion seems to contradict the analysis above. If Bonnie is a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities, she would be a student who attends the school, which contradicts the part where she is described as an inactive and disinterested member of the community. \n\nTherefore, the conclusion cannot be true given the premises, so the answer is FALSE.\n\nANSWER:\tFalse\n", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if Bonnie either chaperones high school dances or, if she does not, she performs in school talent shows often, then Bonnie is both a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities and an inactive and disinterested member of the community. We know that Bonnie is either both attends and is very engaged with school events and is a student who attends the school, or she neither attends and is very engaged with school events nor is a student who attends the school. Now, let's evaluate each case separately. Case 1: Bonnie attends and is very engaged with school events and is a student who attends the school. In this case, Bonnie chaperones high school dances, so Bonnie is also a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities and an inactive and disinterested member of the community. So the statement holds true in this case. Case 2: Bonnie neither attends and is very engaged with school events nor is a student who attends the school. In this case, Bonnie performs in school talent shows often, so Bonnie is also a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities and an inactive and disinterested member of the community. So the statement holds true in this case as well. In both cases, Bonnie satisfies the conclusion.

If James is a manager, he cannot work remotely from home, so he must appear in the company today. If James is neither a manager nor appears in the company today, he must work remotely from home. Since managers cannot work remotely from home, if James is not a manager, he must not appear in the company today.

Thus, he would need to be working remotely, which contradicts Premise 5 for being in another country.\n- If James is not in another country, then he cannot work remotely and must be working on-site.\n- Therefore, if James is a manager, he must have lunch in the company (as per Premise 2), and he appears in the company today (as per Premise 1).\n- This means that James, if a manager, does have lunch in the company.\n\nCase 2: James is not a manager.\n- From Premise 7, if James is not a manager, then he does not appear in the company today.\n- If James does not appear in the company today, then by Premise 1, he has not scheduled any meetings with customers.\n- From Premise 2, if James has not scheduled meetings with customers, he has not had lunch in the company.\n- From Premise 3, since James has not had lunch in the company, he must have had lunch at home.\n- From Premise 4, since James has had lunch at home, he is working remotely from home.\n- From Premise 5, James must be in another country.\n- From Premise 6, James cannot be a manager.\n- Combining these, if James is not a manager, he does not have lunch in the company.\n\nGiven these scenarios, the only conclusion consistent with all premises is that James does not have lunch in the company when he is not a manager.

Employees will either have lunch in the company or have lunch at home.\n4. If an employee has lunch at home, then he/she is working remotely from home.\n5. All employees who are in other countries work remotely from home.\n6. No managers work remotely from home.\n7. James is either a manager and appears in the company today or neither a manager nor appears in the company today.\n\nNow let's evaluate the two parts of the statement:\n\n1. If James is either a manager or in other countries\nFrom premise 6, we know that no managers work remotely from home. So, if James is a manager, he cannot work remotely from home. From premise 5, we also know that all employees who are in other countries work remotely from home. So, if James is in other countries, he can work remotely from home. However, if James is both a manager and in other countries, he cannot work remotely from home due to the contradiction in premise 6.\n\n2. Then James either has lunch at home and works remotely from home, or neither has lunch at home nor works remotely from home\nFrom premise 3, we know that employees will either have lunch in the company or have lunch at home. From premise 4, we know that if an employee has lunch at home, then he/she is working remotely from home. So, if James has lunch at home, he will work remotely from home. From premise 7, we know that James is either a manager and appears in the company today or neither a manager nor appears in the company today. This means that James will either have lunch in the company and work in the office, or have lunch at home and work remotely from home.\n\nCombining the two parts, if James is either a manager or in other countries, then James either has lunch at home and works remotely from home, or neither has lunch at home nor works remotely from home. Therefore, the statement is true.\nANSWER:\tTrue\n", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate the conclusion. We know that all employees who schedule a meeting with their customers appear in the company today. We also know that everyone who has lunch in the company schedules meetings with their customers. Therefore, everyone who has lunch in the company appears in the company today. We know that employees will either have lunch in the company or have lunch at home. We also know that if an employee has lunch at home, then he/she is working remotely from home. We also know that all employees who are in other countries work remotely from home, and no managers work remotely from home. This means that all managers who are in other countries must have lunch at home and work remotely from home. Now, consider the case where James is a manager in another country. We know that managers who are in other countries must have lunch at home and work remotely from home, so this part of the conclusion is true. Now consider the case where James is a manager but not in another country. We know that no managers work remotely from home, so they must have lunch at home, and they must appear in the company today. This part of the conclusion is also true. Therefore, we know that if James is either a manager or in other countries, then James either has lunch at home and works remotely from home, or neither has lunch at home nor works remotely from home, so the conclusion is true.\nANSWER: True\n", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate the statement \"If James is either a manager or in other countries, then James either has lunch at home and works remotely from home, or neither has lunch at home nor works remotely from home\".\n\nWe know that if James is a manager, he will not work remotely from home according to the third premise. We also know that if James is in other countries, he will work remotely from home according to the fourth premise. From the second premise, if James has lunch at home, he will not schedule meetings with his customers, so he will not appear in the company today. Therefore, if James is either a manager or in other countries, then James will not appear in the company today, and either he will have lunch at home or he will not work remotely from home. \n\nTherefore, the statement is true.\n\nANSWER:\tTrue\n", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate the conclusion, \"If James is either a manager or in other countries, then James either has lunch at home and works remotely from home, or neither has lunch at home nor works remotely from home.\"\n\nGiven:\n1. All employees who schedule a meeting with their customers will appear in the company today.\n2. Everyone who has lunch in the company schedules meetings with their customers.\n3. Employees will either have lunch in the company or have lunch at home.\n4. If an employee has lunch at home, then he/she is working remotely from home.\n5. All employees who are in other countries work remotely from home.\n6. No managers work remotely from home.\n7. James is either a manager and appears in the company today or neither a manager nor appears in the company today.\n\nLet's break down the conclusion statement into two parts to understand it better:\n\nPart 1: If James is a manager or in other countries:\n- James is a manager (from premise 6, we know no managers work remotely from home).\n- James is in other countries (from premise 5, we know all employees in other countries work remotely from home).\n\nPart 2: Then James either has lunch at home and works remotely from home, or neither has lunch at home nor works remotely from home:\n- If James is a manager, then he appears in the company today, and therefore does not have lunch at home (from premise 1 and premise 2, a meeting implies presence in the company, and lunch implies meeting).\n- If James is in other countries, then he works remotely from home (from premise 5), and therefore he does not have lunch in the company (from premise 3, since he works remotely from home, he cannot have lunch in the company).\n- In both cases, James cannot have lunch at home and work remotely from home (contradicting premise 4).\n\nTherefore, given the premises and the conclusion, it seems that the conclusion does not hold true because it assumes that James, being a manager or in other countries, will either work remotely from home or have lunch at home, which is not supported by the premises provided.\n\nANSWER: Uncertain (based on the premises provided)\n", "Let's think step by step.\n\nWe are given the following premises:\n1. All employees who schedule a meeting with their customers will appear in the company today.\n2. Everyone who has lunch in the company schedules meetings with their customers.\n3. Employees will either have lunch in the company or have lunch at home.\n4. If an employee has lunch at home, then he/she is working remotely from home.\n5. All employees who are in other countries work remotely from home.\n6. No managers work remotely from home.\n7. James is either a manager and appears in the company today or neither a manager nor appears in the company today.\n\nWe want to evaluate the conclusion:\nIf James is either a manager or in other countries, then James either has lunch at home and works remotely from home, or neither has lunch at home nor works remotely from home.\n\nLet's analyze the premises and the conclusion step by step:\n\nFrom premise 2, we know that if James has lunch in the company, he will schedule meetings with his customers. From premise 1, if James schedules meetings with his customers, he will appear in the company today. Therefore, if James has lunch in the company, he will appear in the company today.\n\nFrom premise 3, we know that James will either have lunch in the company or have lunch at home. Therefore, there are two possibilities: James has lunch in the company or James has lunch at home.\n\nFrom premise 4, if James has lunch at home, then he works remotely from home.\n\nFrom premise 5, if James is in other countries, then he works remotely from home.\n\nFrom premise 6, if James is a manager, then he does not work remotely from home.\n\nFrom premise 7, James is either a manager and appears in the company today, or neither a manager nor appears in the company today.\n\nNow, let's analyze the conclusion:\n\nIf James is either a manager or in other countries, then two scenarios can occur:\n\n1. James is a manager and appears in the company today.\n   - In this case, from premise 6, James does not work remotely from home.\n   - Since James is a manager and appears in the company today, he must have lunch in the company (from premises 1 and 2).\n   - Therefore, in this scenario, James has lunch at home and works remotely from home, which contradicts premise 6. So, this scenario is not possible.\n\n2. James is in other countries.\n   - In this case, from premise 5, James works remotely from home.\n   - If James is in other countries and works remotely from home, he cannot have lunch in the company (from premise 3).\n   - Therefore, James must have lunch at home.\n   - If James has lunch at home, then from premise 4, he works remotely from home.\n   - This scenario is consistent with all the premises.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is true. If James is either a manager or in other countries, then James either has lunch at home and works remotely from home, or neither has lunch at home nor works remotely from home.\n\nANSWER: True\n", "Let's think step by step.\n\nThe conclusion has two parts, which we will evaluate separately.\n\n1) If James is either a manager or in other countries, then James either has lunch at home and works remotely from home, or neither has lunch at home nor works remotely from home.\n\nPremises 1, 2, 3, and 4 tell us that if James has lunch at home, then he works remotely from home. However, since the conclusion states that James either works remotely from home or doesn't work remotely from home, it is true regardless of whether James has lunch at home or not. So, the first part of the conclusion is true.\n\n2) If James is either a manager or in other countries, then James neither has lunch at home nor works remotely from home.\n\nPremises 5 and 6 tell us that all managers work in the office and that all employees in other countries work remotely from home. This means that James cannot both be a manager and work remotely from home, and if he is in other countries, he will work remotely from home.\n\nHowever, this conflicts with the first part of the conclusion, which says that James either works remotely from home or not. Since both parts of the conclusion cannot be true at the same time, the conclusion as a whole is uncertain.\n\nANSWER:\tUncertain\n", "Let's think step by step.

To determine this, we need to analyze the premises given.\n\nFirst, from Premise 3, we know that Rock must be either a rabbit or a squirrel (or potentially another animal, but we only have information about rabbits, squirrels, and turtles).\n\nNext, let's consider the characteristics of rabbits and squirrels:\n- From Premise 1, all rabbits are cute.\n- From Premise 5, all squirrels are skittish.\n\nFrom Premise 4, we know that skittish animals are not still. Therefore, since all squirrels are skittish (Premise 5), all squirrels are not still (Premise 4). This means that Rock cannot be a squirrel (Premise 6 states Rock is still).\n\nSince Rock is either a rabbit or a squirrel, and we've established that Rock cannot be a squirrel (because squirrels are not still and Rock is still), it must be that Rock is a rabbit.\n\nFinally, since Rock is a rabbit and there is no premise connecting rabbits directly to turtles, we can conclude that Rock is not a turtle.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"Rock is not a turtle\" logically follows from the given premises.\n\nANSWER: True\n", "Let's think step by step.

In this case, the premise tells us that Rock is still, and since we know that squirrels are skittish, this means that Rock cannot be a squirrel. Since Rock is not a turtle, we don't have any information about whether Rock is cute or not. However, because Rock is still and we know that being skittish means not being still, we can conclude that Rock is not skittish.\n\nIn summary, the only situation where the conclusion does not hold is when Rock is a turtle and not a squirrel, but we have no information to conclude that Rock is cute or skittish. Therefore, the conclusion is uncertain.\nANSWER:\tUncertain\n", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate the statement \"if Rock is not both a turtle and a squirrel, then Rock is either cute or skittish\".\n\nStep 1: Evaluate the hypothesis: \"Rock is not both a turtle and a squirrel\"\nWe know that Rock is still. The premise tells us that all squirrels are skittish and Rock is still, so Rock cannot be a squirrel. We also know that some turtles exist, so it's possible that Rock could be a turtle. But we don't have enough information to say whether Rock is a turtle or not. So, we cannot definitively conclude that Rock is not both a turtle and a squirrel.\n\nStep 2: Evaluate the conclusion: \"Rock is either cute or skittish\"\nWe know that all rabbits are cute, but we don't know if Rock is a rabbit. We also know that all squirrels are skittish, but we know that Rock cannot be a squirrel. So, we cannot definitively conclude that Rock is skittish.\n\nSince we cannot definitively evaluate the hypothesis and conclusion, the statement is uncertain.\nANSWER:\tUncertain\n", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if the conclusion \"if Rock is not both a turtle and a squirrel, then Rock is either cute or skittish\" is true. We know that Rock is still, and from premise 6, if something is skittish, then it is not still. Therefore, Rock is not skittish. We also know that all squirrels are skittish, so Rock cannot be a squirrel. From premise 1, we know that all rabbits are cute. Since Rock is neither a squirrel nor a turtle, the only option left is that Rock is a rabbit, and since rabbits are cute, the conclusion that Rock is either cute or skittish holds true. Therefore, the conclusion is true.\nANSWER:\tTrue\n", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if \"If Rock is not both a turtle and a squirrel, then Rock is either cute or skittish\" is true given the premises.\n\nPremise 1 tells us that all rabbits are cute, and Premise 2 tells us that some turtles exist. Premise 3 tells us that an animal can only be a rabbit or a squirrel. Premise 4 tells us that if something is skittish, then it is not still, and Premise 5 tells us that all squirrels are skittish. Premise 6 tells us that Rock is still.\n\nFrom these premises, we can infer the following:\n1. Since Rock is still, it cannot be skittish (from Premise 4 and 6).\n2. Rock cannot be a squirrel, because if it were, it would have to be skittish (from Premise 5 and 6).\n3. Rock cannot be both a turtle and a squirrel because it is still and squirrels are skittish (from Premise 3, 5, and 6).\n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion \"If Rock is not both a turtle and a squirrel, then Rock is either cute or skittish.\" From our inference, we know Rock is not skittish. Since Rock is not skittish, the only part of the conclusion that needs to be checked is \"then Rock is either cute or skittish.\"\n\nFrom Premise 1, we know that rabbits are cute. However, since Rock is not a squirrel, and squirrels are skittish (from Premise 5), and Rock is not skittish (from Premise 6 and our inference), Rock cannot be a rabbit either (since it's not stated that rabbits are only cute, and it doesn't exclude other non-rabbit animals from being cute). Therefore, we cannot conclude that Rock is cute from the given premises.\n\nSince we cannot conclude that Rock is cute, and we know that Rock is not skittish, the only part of the conclusion that is satisfied is that Rock is not skittish. The conclusion \"If Rock is not both a turtle and a squirrel, then Rock is either cute or skittish\" is not fully satisfied because we cannot confirm that Rock is cute. However, the premise does not contradict the conclusion, as the conclusion allows for the possibility that Rock is cute, but also includes being skittish as a separate possibility.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is true, as it does not contradict the given premises, even though we cannot confirm the \"cute\" part of the conclusion.\nANSWER:\tTrue\n", "Let's think step by step. We need to determine if the conclusion \"If Rock is not both a turtle and a squirrel, then Rock is either cute or skittish\" logically follows from the given premises.\n\n1. From premise 2, we know that an animal is either a rabbit or a squirrel.\n2. From premise 1, all rabbits are cute.\n3. From premise 4, all squirrels are skittish.\n4. From premise 5, Rock is still.\n5. From premise 6, if something is skittish, then it is not still. Since Rock is still, it cannot be skittish. Therefore, Rock cannot be a squirrel.\n\nNow, considering the conclusion, we have to evaluate the statement \"If Rock is not both a turtle and a squirrel, then Rock is either cute or skittish.\"\n\n- Since Rock is not a squirrel (from step 5), we need to evaluate if Rock is either cute or skittish.\n- Since Rock is still, it cannot be skittish (from step 5). Therefore, the only option left for Rock is to be cute.\n\nSo, if Rock is not both a turtle and a squirrel, Rock must be cute.\n\nThus, the conclusion \"If Rock is not both a turtle and a squirrel, then Rock is either cute or skittish\" follows logically from the premises. The answer is True.\n\nANSWER: True\n", "Let's think step by step. First, we know that Rock is still, and if something is skittish, then it is not still. Therefore, Rock cannot be a squirrel. Second, we know that if something is not both a turtle and a squirrel, then it is either cute or skittish. Since Rock is not a squirrel, the only option left for Rock is to be a turtle.

Combining these two pieces of information, we can conclude that if Marvin is from Mars, Marvin is not a human.\n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion \"If Marvin is not from Mars, then Marvin is a human.\" From premise 5, we know that Marvin cannot be from Earth and from Mars. This means that Marvin must be from Mars or not from Earth. If Marvin is from Mars, then from our previous conclusion, Marvin is not a human. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that Marvin is not from Mars, and since Marvin is not from Earth either (as per premise 5), Marvin must be an extraterrestrial (premise 6).

Now, let's consider if Marvin is not from Mars. We know that if someone is from Mars, they are aliens, and aliens are extraterrestrial, and extraterrestrial are not humans. So, if Marvin is not from Mars, Marvin is an extraterrestrial, which is not a human. Therefore, the conclusion is false, so the answer is false.\nANSWER:\tFalse\n", "Let's think step by step.

Since Djokovic is famous, he is also well paid (because of the premise that \"if a person is a celebrity then they are well paid\"). \n\nCombining these two pieces of information, we know that Djokovic lives in a tax haven.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"Djokovic does not live in a tax haven\" is FALSE.\n\nANSWER:\tFalse\n", "Let's break down the premises and the conclusion step by step to understand the logical flow.\n\nPremise 1: A person is either a Grand Slam champion or an Oscar-nominated actor.\nPremise 2: All Grand Slam champions are professional tennis players.\nPremise 3: All Oscar-nominated actors are celebrities.\nPremise 4: All professional tennis players are athletes.\nPremise 5: If a person is a celebrity then they are well paid.\nPremise 6: If a person is an athlete then they are famous.\nPremise 7: All well-paid people live in tax havens.\nPremise 8: If Djokovic is famous and is an athlete, then Djokovic lives in well-paid.\n\nConclusion: Djokovic does not live in a tax haven.\n\nNow let's consider Djokovic. According to Premise 1, Djokovic is either a Grand Slam champion or an Oscar-nominated actor. If he is a Grand Slam champion, Premises 2 and 4 tell us he is a professional tennis player and an athlete. Premise 6 then tells us that he is famous. With Premise 5, we know that because he is famous, he is well paid. Premise 7 tells us that all well-paid people live in tax havens. This would mean that Djokovic lives in a tax haven if he is a Grand Slam champion.\n\nHowever, we also know from Premise 8 that if Djokovic is famous and an athlete, then he lives in well paid. Since being famous and an athlete would also make him well paid, and being well paid would mean living in a tax haven, this seems to confirm that he does live in a tax haven if he is a Grand Slam champion.\n\nThe conclusion states that Djokovic does not live in a tax haven, which contradicts the logical flow derived from the premises. Therefore, the conclusion is not supported by the premises.\n\nANSWER:\tFalse\n", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if Djokovic does not live in a tax haven.\n\n1. From the premises, we know that all professional tennis players are athletes.\n2.

The premise also states that if a person is an athlete, then they are famous. So Djokovic, being an athlete, is famous.\n4. The next premise tells us that all well-paid people live in tax havens. Since Djokovic is famous, he is well paid, and therefore he lives in a tax haven.\n5. The last premise states that if Djokovic is famous and an athlete, then he lives in a well-paid place. This reinforces the fact that Djokovic lives in a tax haven.\n\nConclusion: Given the information provided in the premises, Djokovic does live in a tax haven.

Everyone who lost to Iga \u015awi\u0105tek is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association.\n3. All female tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 lost to Iga \u015awi\u0105tek.\n4. Either female tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 or male tennis players at Roland Garros 2022.\n5. All male tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 lost to Rafael Nadal.\n6. If Coco Gauff is a player who is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association or a player who lost to Rafael Nadal, then Coco Gauff is not a male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022.\n\nFrom premises 2 and 3, we can deduce that all female tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 are ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association. Since being ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association means being among the most active players in major tennis, all female tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 are among the most active players in major tennis.\n\nPremise 4 tells us that either female tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 or male tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 exist, so Coco Gauff must be a female tennis player at Roland Garros 2022 (because she is not a male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022, as stated in premise 6).\n\nSince all female tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 are among the most active players in major tennis, Coco Gauff, being one of them, is also among the most active players in major tennis.\n\nANSWER: True\n\n", "Let's think step by step.

From premise 3, we know that all female tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 lost to Iga \u015awi\u0105tek.

From premise 4, we know that either female tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 or male tennis players at Roland Garros 2022. Therefore, either Coco Gauff is among the most active players in major tennis, or Coco Gauff is not. From premise 5, we know that all male tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 lost to Rafael Nadal. From premise 6, we know that if Coco Gauff is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association or a player who lost to Rafael Nadal, then Coco Gauff is not a male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022.

The third premise tells us that all female tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 lost to Iga \u015awi\u0105tek. So, all female tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 are ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association and are among the most active players in major tennis. The fourth premise tells us that either female tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 or male tennis players at Roland Garros 2022. The fifth premise tells us that all male tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 lost to Rafael Nadal. The sixth premise tells us that if Coco Gauff is a player who is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association or a player who lost to Rafael Nadal, then Coco Gauff is not a male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022. We don't have any information about Coco Gauff's gender, but we can infer that Coco Gauff is a female tennis player at Roland Garros 2022 because if she were a male tennis player, she would have lost to Rafael Nadal, and therefore, she would not be ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association according to the sixth premise. Since Coco Gauff is a female tennis player at Roland Garros 2022, and all female tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 are among the most active players in major tennis, we can conclude that Coco Gauff is among the most active players in major tennis.\nANSWER:\tTrue\n", "Let's think step by step.

Therefore, all female tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 are among the most active players in major tennis.\n\nFrom Premise 3, we know that all female tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 lost to Iga \u015awi\u0105tek. Therefore, all female tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 are both among the most active players in major tennis and lost to Iga \u015awi\u0105tek.\n\nFrom Premise 4, we know that either female tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 or male tennis players at Roland Garros 2022. Therefore, either female tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 or male tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 are among the most active players in major tennis.\n\nFrom Premise 5, we know that all male tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 lost to Rafael Nadal. Therefore, all male tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 are among the most active players in major tennis and lost to Rafael Nadal.\n\nFrom Premise 6, we know that if Coco Gauff is a player who is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association or a player who lost to Rafael Nadal, then Coco Gauff is not a male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022. Since we know that either female tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 or male tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 are among the most active players in major tennis, Coco Gauff must be either among the most active players in major tennis or lost to Rafael Nadal.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n1. If Coco Gauff is among the most active players in major tennis, she cannot be a male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022. Therefore, Coco Gauff must be a female tennis player at Roland Garros 2022.\n\n2. If Coco Gauff lost to Rafael Nadal, she must be a male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022. However, this contradicts Premise 6, which states that Coco Gauff cannot be a male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022 if she is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association or lost to Rafael Nadal.\n\nTherefore, the only possible scenario is that Coco Gauff is among the most active players in major tennis and a female tennis player at Roland Garros 2022. However, this contradicts Premise 6, which states that Coco Gauff cannot be a male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022 if she is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association or lost to Rafael Nadal.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude that Coco Gauff has lost to Rafael Nadal based on the given premises.\n\nANSWER:\tUncertain\n", "Let's think step by step.

From the first premise, we know that if Coco Gauff is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association, then she is among the most active players in major tennis. From the second premise, we know that all female tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 lost to Iga \u015awi\u0105tek, and from the third premise, we know that all male tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 lost to Rafael Nadal. This means Coco Gauff cannot be a male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022. Since Coco Gauff cannot be a male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022, she must be a female tennis player, and therefore she must have lost to Iga \u015awi\u0105tek, which means she lost to Rafael Nadal.

We also know from premise 5 that all male tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 lost to Rafael Nadal. Now, let's look at premise 6. This premise tells us that if Coco Gauff is a player who is ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association or a player who lost to Rafael Nadal, then Coco Gauff is not a male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022. This premise establishes that if Coco Gauff lost to Rafael Nadal, then she cannot be a male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022. However, we already know from premise 5 that all male tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 lost to Rafael Nadal, so if Coco Gauff lost to Rafael Nadal, she cannot be a male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022. This means Coco Gauff cannot be a male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022 if she lost to Rafael Nadal.

Since the conclusion claims that Coco Gauff is not among the most active players in major tennis, we can assume that she is not ranked highly by the Women's Tennis Association.

If 1984 is a streaming service, then 1984 is a hardcover book.\n\nWe want to determine whether the conclusion \"1984 is printed text\" is true, false, or uncertain given the premises.\n\nFirst, let's consider premise 5, which states that if 1984 is a streaming service, then 1984 is a hardcover book. This premise gives us a conditional statement: if 1984 is a streaming service, then it must be a hardcover book.\n\nNow, let's look at premise 3, which tells us that all streaming services are digital.

Since Mike needs to apply for CPT, it means that he has an F1 visa, because CPT is a requirement for students with F1 visas who want to work in the US. Therefore, the statement that Mike has a J1 visa is false because we have concluded that he has an F1 visa. So the conclusion is false.\nANSWER:\tFalse\n", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if Mike has a J1 visa. First, let's consider the premises. We know that an international student in the US has either an F1 visa or a J1 visa. We also know that Mike is an international student. This tells us that Mike has one of these two visas. Now, let's consider the additional information given: Mike needs to apply for CPT (Curricular Practical Training) if he wants to work in the US. We also know from the second premise that an international student with an F1 visa needs to apply for CPT if they want to work in the US. Since Mike needs to apply for CPT, we can conclude that Mike has an F1 visa, not a J1 visa. Therefore, the conclusion that Mike has a J1 visa is false.

We know that Mike is an international student in the US, which means he must have either an F1 or J1 visa. We also know that Mike needs to apply for CPT to work in the US, and that CPT is available only to students with F1 visas. Since Mike needs to apply for CPT, this means Mike has an F1 visa and not a J1 visa. Therefore, the conclusion that Mike has a J1 visa is false.\n\nANSWER:\tFalse\n", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if Mike has a J1 visa.\n\nPremise 1 states that international students in the US have either an F1 visa or a J1 visa.

This means that if Mike wants to work in the US, he needs to apply for either CPT or OPT. But the premise does not necessarily mean that Mike has an F1 visa. He could also have a J1 visa and not need to apply for CPT or OPT, since those are specific to F1 visa holders.\n\nPremise 3 states that Mike needs to apply for CPT if he wants to work in the US. This premise only tells us that Mike must have an F1 visa in order to apply for CPT. It does not provide any information about Mike having a J1 visa or not.\n\nFrom these premises, we can only conclude that Mike must have either an F1 visa or a J1 visa.

From the third premise, we know that Mike is an international student. From the fourth premise, we know that Mike needs to apply for CPT if he wants to work in the US. Given that an international student with an F1 visa needs to apply for CPT or OPT to work, we can deduce that Mike has an F1 visa because he needs to apply for CPT to work.

From the premise \"If something is a bovine, then it is domesticated,\" we can conclude that Ted, being a cow, is domesticated.\n4. From the premise \"No domesticated animals are alligators,\" and the fact that Ted is an alligator, we can conclude that Ted cannot be domesticated.\n5. We now have a contradiction because Ted cannot be both domesticated and not domesticated at the same time.\n6. This contradiction implies that the premise \"Ted is an alligator\" cannot be true, as it leads to a logical inconsistency with the premises.\n7. Since the premise \"Ted is an alligator\" leads to a contradiction, the conclusion \"If Ted is a cow, then Ted is not a pet\" is not affected by Ted's actual status as an alligator.\n8. However, the conclusion can still be evaluated based on the information given about cows and pets. Since some pets are cows, if Ted were a cow, he would also be a pet.\n9.

Therefore, the statement is true.\nANSWER:\tTrue\n", "Let's think step by step. The statement we need to evaluate is \"if Ted is a cow, then Ted is not a pet\". We can break this down into two parts:\n\n1. If Ted is a cow, then Ted is a bovine (from the premise that all cows are bovines).\n2. If Ted is a bovine, then Ted is domesticated (from the premise that all bovines are domesticated).\n3. If Ted is domesticated, then Ted is not an alligator (from the premise that no domesticated animals are alligators).\n\nSince Ted is an alligator, he cannot be domesticated. This means Ted cannot be a bovine, and therefore, Ted cannot be a cow. Since Ted is not a cow, the first part of the statement \"if Ted is a cow, then Ted is not a pet\" is vacuously true, because it is not the case that Ted is a cow. Therefore, the conclusion \"if Ted is a cow, then Ted is not a pet\" is true, but it is based on the fact that Ted cannot be a cow.\n\nThe answer is: True.\n", "Let's think step by step.

Since Ted is an alligator, we know that Ted is not a domesticated animal. And since Ted is not a domesticated animal, we know that Ted is not a cow. Since Ted is not a cow, Ted cannot be a pet.

Since Ted is not a cow, the premise \"If Ted is a cow, then Ted is not a pet\" is vacuously true because the antecedent (\"Ted is a cow\") is false.\n\nTherefore, the statement is true.\n\nANSWER: True\n", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if \"If Ted is a cow, then Ted is not a pet\" is true, false, or uncertain.\n\n1. From the first premise, we know that all cows are bovines.\n2. The second premise tells us that some pets are cows.\n3. Combining the first two premises, we can deduce that some pets are bovines (because cows are a subset of bovines, and some pets are cows).\n4. The third premise states that if something is a bovine, then it is domesticated.\n5. Combining premises 1 and 3, we deduce that some pets are domesticated (because some pets are bovines, and bovines are domesticated).\n6. The fourth premise tells us that no domesticated animals are alligators.\n7. From premise 6 and the deduction in step 5, we can deduce that no pets are alligators (because pets are domesticated, and domesticated animals are not alligators).\n8. Premise 7 states that Ted is an alligator, so Ted is not a pet (because no pets are alligators, and Ted is an alligator).\n9. The conclusion we want to evaluate is \"If Ted is a cow, then Ted is not a pet.\"\n10. From the conclusion, we have a conditional statement: \"If Ted is a cow, then Ted is not a pet.\"\n11. We know from step 8 that Ted is not a pet, but the conclusion does not depend on Ted being a pet or not, it only depends on the statement that Ted is a cow.\n12. The truth of the conclusion does not depend on Ted's status as a pet because the conclusion only concerns the relationship between being a cow and not being a pet.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"If Ted is a cow, then Ted is not a pet\" is TRUE regardless of Ted's pet status, because it is true by the definition that cows are not pets (as per the premises).

Premise 3: If something is a bovine, then it is domesticated.\n   - This means that if Ted is a cow (and thus a bovine), Ted is domesticated.\n\n4. Premise 4: No domesticated animals are alligators.\n   - This means that if Ted is an alligator, Ted cannot be domesticated.\n\n5. Premise 5: Ted is an alligator.\n   - This means that Ted is an alligator.\n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion: \"If Ted is a cow, then Ted is not a pet.\"\n\n- From Premise 1, we know that if Ted is a cow, Ted is a bovine.\n- From Premise 3, we know that if Ted is a bovine, Ted is domesticated.\n- From Premise 4, we know that no domesticated animals are alligators.\n- From Premise 5, we know that Ted is an alligator.\n\nGiven that Ted is an alligator, Ted cannot be domesticated. If Ted were domesticated, Ted would contradict being an alligator (Premise 4).

However, since KO is a mature company's stock, KO's stock price cannot be volatile. This means that the disjunction is false because it cannot be true that KO's stock price is volatile and KO is not a growth company's stock at the same time.\n\nThe conclusion as a whole is therefore FALSE.\nANSWER:\tFalse\n", "Let\u2019s think step by step.

Therefore, KO is not a growth company\u2019s stock. We also know that all growth companies\u2019 stocks are volatile. If KO is a growth company\u2019s stock, it would be volatile. However, since KO is not a growth company\u2019s stock, it is not necessarily volatile. Therefore, the statement that KO is neither a company\u2019s stock nor is its price volatile is false.

The conclusion states that if KO is a growth company\u2019s stock or if its price is volatile, then KO is neither a company\u2019s stock nor is its price volatile. This is a contradiction because KO cannot be both a growth company\u2019s stock and not a company\u2019s stock at the same time.\n\n5.

They also tell us that KO is a mature company\u2019s stock and that mature company stocks are suitable for a retirement fund. Therefore, KO is not a growth company\u2019s stock. Now we need to evaluate the conclusion. The conclusion states that if KO is a growth company\u2019s stock or if its price is volatile, then KO is neither a company\u2019s stock nor is its price volatile. Since we know that KO is not a growth company\u2019s stock, the first part of the conclusion (\"if KO is a growth company\u2019s stock\") is false. However, since KO is a mature company\u2019s stock, its price cannot be volatile. Therefore, the second part of the conclusion (\"if its price is volatile\") is also false.

We know that KO is a mature company\u2019s stock, and mature company\u2019s stocks are suitable for a retirement fund.

However, since KO is a mature company's stock, it cannot be a growth company\u2019s stock, and therefore it is not volatile. The conclusion states that if KO is a growth company\u2019s stock or if its price is volatile, then KO is neither a company\u2019s stock nor is its price volatile. This is a statement about a hypothetical situation that contradicts the facts given in the premises. Since KO is not a growth company\u2019s stock and its price is not volatile (because it is a mature company's stock), the antecedent of the implication in the conclusion is false. In logic, a conditional statement (if P then Q) is only false if P is true and Q is false. Since P is not true, the conclusion cannot be evaluated as true or false based on the premises. Therefore, the conclusion is uncertain.\nANSWER:\tUncertain\n", "The conclusion introduces a biconditional statement that does not logically follow from the premises.

However, this statement contradicts the given premises. We know that KO is a mature company's stock, and therefore, it is suitable for a retirement fund. This contradicts the premise that all growth companies' stocks are volatile and not suitable for retirement funds. Additionally, we do not have any information about the volatility of KO's stock price. So, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises, and the answer is uncertain.\nANSWER:\tUncertain\n", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if the conclusion \"If KO is a growth company\u2019s stock or if its price is volatile, then KO is neither a company\u2019s stock nor is its price volatile\" is true, false, or uncertain given the premises.

The conclusion states that if either condition is true, then KO is neither a company\u2019s stock nor its price volatile.\n\nLet's evaluate each part of the conclusion against the premises:\n\na. KO is a growth company\u2019s stock:\n   - According to Premise 5, KO is a mature company\u2019s stock. Mature companies are not growth companies, so KO cannot be a growth company\u2019s stock. This part of the conclusion contradicts the premises.\n\nb. Its price is volatile:\n   - According to Premise 5, KO is a mature company\u2019s stock, which are suitable for a retirement fund (Premise 4). Mature companies' stocks are not described as volatile. Therefore, it contradicts Premise 1 that all growth companies' stocks are volatile. Since KO is not a growth company, its price is not volatile.\n\n3. The conclusion states that KO is neither a company\u2019s stock nor its price volatile:\n   - KO is a company\u2019s stock (Premise 5).\n   - KO's price is not volatile (as inferred from the above analysis).\n\n4. The conclusion contradicts itself because it states that KO is neither a company\u2019s stock nor its price volatile, while Premise 5 clearly states that KO is a company\u2019s stock.\n\nGiven the contradictions and the analysis above, the conclusion is FALSE because it directly contradicts Premise 5.\n\nANSWER:\tFalse\n", "Let's think step by step.

We want to evaluate if Mary needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition. According to the first premise, if people work in student jobs on campus, then they need to earn money to help pay for their college tuition. However, the second premise says that if people order takeout frequently in college, then they work in student jobs on campus. The third premise says that people either order takeout frequently in college or enjoy the dining hall meals and recipes. So, if Mary orders takeout frequently in college, then she works in student jobs on campus, which means she needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition.

The conclusion is that Mary needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition.

However, this alone doesn't directly tell us if Mary needs to earn money, as we don't know Mary's situation.\n\nPremise 2 suggests a connection between ordering takeout frequently and working in student jobs. If Mary orders takeout frequently, it could imply that she works in student jobs and thus needs to earn money. However, we don't have information about Mary's habits regarding takeout.\n\nPremise 3 states that people either order takeout frequently or enjoy dining hall meals. This premise doesn't give us any information about Mary specifically.\n\nPremise 4 and Premise 5 describe characteristics of people who enjoy dining hall meals and recipes, but these don't directly relate to Mary's need to earn money.\n\nPremise 6 introduces a condition for Mary, suggesting that if she works in student jobs and needs to earn money, then she is neither picky nor needs to earn money. This premise doesn't support the conclusion that Mary needs to earn money.\n\nBased on the given premises, we cannot directly infer that Mary needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition.

But in the premises, we also know that if Mary works in student jobs on campus, then she is neither picky nor needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition. This creates a contradiction. If Mary is neither picky nor needs to earn money, then she doesn't need to earn money to help pay for her college tuition, which contradicts the first part of the premise that if people work in student jobs on campus, they need to earn money to help pay for their college tuition.

Next, let's consider the premise that if people work in student jobs on campus and need to earn money to help pay for their college tuition, then they are not picky eaters and do not need to earn money to help pay for their college tuition. This premise contradicts our first premise, as it states that Mary needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition, which means she is a picky eater.

We want to evaluate if Mary either is not a picky eater or, if she is, then she spends a lot of her time eating and catching up with friends in the campus dining halls. The premises state that if people work in student jobs on campus, they need to earn money to help pay for their college tuition, and if people order takeout frequently in college, then they work in student jobs on campus. However, there is no premise that directly relates Mary working in student jobs to her being a picky eater or not. The premise about people who enjoy the dining hall meals and recipes being neither picky eaters or spending a lot of their time eating and catching up with friends in the dining halls doesn't help us determine Mary's eating habits or her time spent in dining halls, as it only states what happens to those who enjoy the dining hall meals and recipes, not about those who do not enjoy them. Since we do not have enough information to determine Mary's eating habits or her time spent in dining halls, we cannot conclude the statement as true, false, or uncertain. However, we can infer that since Mary is neither a picky eater nor needs to earn money to help pay for her college tuition, she could be one of the people who enjoy the dining hall meals and recipes, which means she might not be a picky eater. Still, we cannot determine if she spends a lot of her time eating and catching up with friends in the campus dining halls based on the given premises.\nANSWER:\tUncertain\n\n"], "answers": ["True", "True", "True", "True", "Uncertain", "True", "True", "True", "True", "Uncertain"], "reference": "False", "time_total": 31.626999139785767, "time_llm": 31.625717401504517, "prompt_length": 9200}

No bakery is spicy.\n2. All cupcakes are bakeries.\n3. All hotpots are spicy.\n4. All products of Baked by Melissa are cupcakes.\n5. If dried Thai chilies are spicy or a bakery, then dried Thai chilies are a hotpot or are spicy.\n\nFrom premise 2, we know that all cupcakes are bakeries. Premise 4 tells us that all products of Baked by Melissa are cupcakes, which means all products of Baked by Melissa are also bakeries. Given that no bakery is spicy (premise 1), it follows that none of the products of Baked by Melissa are spicy. However, this information about spiciness doesn't directly tell us about dried Thai chilies being a product of Baked by Melissa.\n\nPremise 5 is about dried Thai chilies being spicy or a bakery. If dried Thai chilies are spicy or a bakery, then they are either a hotpot or spicy. Since hotpots are spicy (premise 3), this premise confirms that dried Thai chilies can be spicy or a hotpot. But it doesn't directly relate dried Thai chilies to being a product of Baked by Melissa.\n\nSince there is no information directly connecting dried Thai chilies to being a product of Baked by Melissa, we cannot conclude that dried Thai chilies are not a product of Baked by Melissa.

Since dried Thai chilies are already identified as spicy, this premise does not provide additional information about dried Thai chilies.\n\nSecond, we are given that no bakery is spicy, and all cupcakes are bakeries. Therefore, no cupcakes can be spicy, which means dried Thai chilies cannot be a cupcake and thus cannot be a bakery.\n\nThird, we are given that all products of Baked by Melissa are cupcakes. Since we have already determined that dried Thai chilies cannot be a cupcake, it follows that dried Thai chilies cannot be a product of Baked by Melissa.\n\nCombining these pieces of information, we can conclude that dried Thai chilies are neither a product of Baked by Melissa nor a bakery, as they cannot be spicy and thus cannot be a cupcake or a bakery.\n\nANSWER: True\n", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if dried Thai chilies are neither a product of Baked by Melissa nor a bakery.\n\nFrom premise 3, we know that all cupcakes are bakeries, and from premise 2, we know that all products of Baked by Melissa are cupcakes. Therefore, we can conclude that all products of Baked by Melissa are bakeries.\n\nFrom premise 1, we know that no bakery is spicy. Since dried Thai chilies are either spicy or a bakery, they cannot be a bakery. Therefore, dried Thai chilies are not a bakery.\n\nSince dried Thai chilies are neither spicy nor a bakery, we can conclude that dried Thai chilies are neither a product of Baked by Melissa (since all products of Baked by Melissa are bakeries) nor a bakery.\n\nANSWER: True\n", "Let's think step by step.

Therefore, all products of Baked by Melissa are bakeries.\n\nPremise 5 tells us that if dried Thai chilies are spicy or a bakery, then they are a hotpot or are spicy. This means that if dried Thai chilies are spicy or a bakery, they cannot be something that is not spicy or a bakery.\n\nSince we already know that dried Thai chilies cannot be spicy (because all hotpots are spicy and dried Thai chilies are not mentioned to be hotpots), they also cannot be a bakery because that would contradict Premise 5.\n\nTherefore, dried Thai chilies cannot be a product of Baked by Melissa (since all products of Baked by Melissa are bakeries), nor can they be a bakery.

This conclusion can be broken down into two parts: (A) dried Thai chilies are cupcakes, and (B) dried Thai chilies are a product of Baked by Melissa.\n\n(A) Given that all cupcakes are bakeries and no bakery is spicy, we know that cupcakes are not spicy.

The conclusion states that \"If Subway provides take-out service and receives many negative reviews, then its rating is greater than 9 and it does not provide take-out service.\" This conclusion can be broken down into two parts: \n\n1. Subway provides take-out service.\n2. Subway receives many negative reviews.\n\nFrom the premises, we know that:\n- If a restaurant receives many negative reviews, it is not listed in Yelp's recommendations.\n- All restaurants with a rating greater than 9 are listed in Yelp's recommendations.\n- All restaurants that are popular among local residents have ratings greater than 9.\n- Subway has a rating greater than 9 or is popular among local residents.\n\nSince Subway has a rating greater than 9, it is listed in Yelp's recommendations and does not receive many negative reviews. Therefore, the first part of the conclusion (Subway provides take-out service) is false because Subway cannot receive many negative reviews if it has a rating greater than 9.\n\nThe second part of the conclusion (Subway does not provide take-out service) is not necessarily false, but it cannot be confirmed as true based on the given premises. We do not have any information about Subway's take-out service.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion as a whole cannot be confirmed as true or false based on the given premises. The correct answer is:\n\nANSWER:\tUncertain\n", "Let's analyze the given premises and the conclusion step by step.\n\nPremise 1: If the restaurant is listed in Yelp\u2019s recommendations, then the restaurant does not receive many negative reviews.\nPremise 2: All restaurants with a rating greater than 9 are listed in Yelp\u2019s recommendations.\nPremise 3: Some restaurants that do not provide take-out service receive many negative reviews.\nPremise 4: All restaurants that are popular among local residents have ratings greater than 9.\nPremise 5: Subway has a rating greater than 9 or is popular among local residents.\n\nConclusion: If Subway provides take-out service and receives many negative reviews, then its rating is greater than 9 and it does not provide take-out service.\n\nLet's break down the conclusion step by step:\n\n1. Subway provides take-out service.\n2. Subway receives many negative reviews.\n3. Subway's rating is greater than 9.\n4. Subway does not provide take-out service.\n\nFrom Premise 3, we know that some restaurants that do not provide take-out service receive many negative reviews. Since Subway receives many negative reviews, it is consistent with this premise.\n\nPremise 2 states that all restaurants with a rating greater than 9 are listed in Yelp\u2019s recommendations. Premise 1 states that if a restaurant is listed in Yelp\u2019s recommendations, it does not receive many negative reviews. Therefore, if Subway has a rating greater than 9, it must be listed in Yelp\u2019s recommendations and cannot receive many negative reviews. This directly contradicts the conclusion that Subway receives many negative reviews if it has a rating greater than 9.\n\nFurthermore, if Subway has a rating greater than 9, it must be listed in Yelp\u2019s recommendations (Premise 2). But if Subway is listed in Yelp\u2019s recommendations, it cannot receive many negative reviews (Premise 1), which means it cannot receive many negative reviews if it has a rating greater than 9.\n\nGiven this contradiction, the conclusion that Subway's rating is greater than 9 and it does not provide take-out service cannot be true based on the given premises. The conclusion violates the logic established by the premises.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is FALSE.\n\nANSWER: False\n", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate the conclusion: \"If Subway provides take-out service and receives many negative reviews, then its rating is greater than 9 and it does not provide take-out service.\" This conclusion is in the form of an implication with two conditions. We need to check if these conditions are logically consistent with the given premises.\n\nPremise 1 states: \"If the restaurant is listed in Yelp\u2019s recommendations, then the restaurant does not receive many negative reviews.\"\nPremise 2 states: \"All restaurants with a rating greater than 9 are listed in Yelp\u2019s recommendations.\"\nPremise 3 states: \"Some restaurants that do not provide take-out service receive many negative reviews.\"\nPremise 4 states: \"All restaurants that are popular among local residents have ratings greater than 9.\"\nPremise 5 states: \"Subway has a rating greater than 9 or is popular among local residents.\"\n\nLet's analyze the conclusion:\n1. \"If Subway provides take-out service and receives many negative reviews, then its rating is greater than 9 and it does not provide take-out service.\"\n\nFirst part of the conclusion: \"Subway receives many negative reviews.\"\n- From Premise 3, we know that some restaurants that do not provide take-out service receive many negative reviews. This does not directly contradict the given premise, but it does not confirm it either.\n\nSecond part of the conclusion: \"Subway's rating is greater than 9.\"\n- From Premise 2, we know that all restaurants with a rating greater than 9 are listed in Yelp\u2019s recommendations. This means if Subway has a rating greater than 9, it would be listed in Yelp\u2019s recommendations.\n- Premise 5 tells us that Subway either has a rating greater than 9 or is popular among local residents. If Subway is popular among local residents, it could also have a rating greater than 9, but it is not explicitly stated.\n\nThird part of the conclusion: \"Subway does not provide take-out service.\"\n- This part of the conclusion follows logically from the initial condition of the conclusion that Subway provides take-out service and receives many negative reviews.\n\nNow, let's put it all together:\n- The conclusion implies that Subway receives many negative reviews and thus does not provide take-out service (based on Premise 3).\n- If Subway has a rating greater than 9, it must be listed in Yelp\u2019s recommendations (based on Premise 2).\n- Subway is either popular among local residents or has a rating greater than 9 (based on Premise 5).\n\nTherefore, if Subway receives many negative reviews, it does not provide take-out service (consistent with Premise 3). If Subway has a rating greater than 9, it must be listed in Yelp\u2019s recommendations (consistent with Premise 2).\n\nThus, the conclusion \"If Subway provides take-out service and receives many negative reviews, then its rating is greater than 9 and it does not provide take-out service\" is logically consistent with the given premises.\n\nANSWER: True", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate the conclusion \"If Subway provides take-out service and receives many negative reviews, then its rating is greater than 9 and it does not provide take-out service.\" First, we know that all restaurants with a rating greater than 9 are listed in Yelp's recommendations. Second, we know that all restaurants with a rating greater than 9 are popular among local residents. Third, we know that some restaurants that do not provide take-out service receive many negative reviews. Fourth, we know that all restaurants that are popular among local residents have ratings greater than 9. Finally, we know that Subway has a rating greater than 9 or is popular among local residents. Based on this information, if Subway receives many negative reviews, it cannot be popular among local residents. So, Subway must have a rating greater than 9. Since Subway has a rating greater than 9, it is listed in Yelp's recommendations, which means it does not provide take-out service. Therefore, the conclusion is true.\nANSWER:\tTrue\n", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if \"if Subway provides take-out service and receives many negative reviews, then its rating is greater than 9 and it does not provide take-out service.\" Let's break down the premises to see if we can derive this conclusion.\n\n1. If the restaurant is listed in Yelp\u2019s recommendations, then the restaurant does not receive many negative reviews.\n2. All restaurants with a rating greater than 9 are listed in Yelp\u2019s recommendations.\n3. Some restaurants that do not provide take-out service receive many negative reviews.\n4. All restaurants that are popular among local residents have ratings greater than 9.\n5. Subway has a rating greater than 9 or is popular among local residents.\n\nFirst, let's analyze what we can infer from these premises:\n\n- Premise 1: If a restaurant is listed in Yelp\u2019s recommendations, it does not receive many negative reviews.\n- Premise 2: A restaurant must have a rating greater than 9 to be listed in Yelp\u2019s recommendations.\n- Premise 3: Some restaurants without take-out service receive many negative reviews.\n- Premise 4: Restaurants that are popular among local residents have ratings greater than 9.\n- Premise 5: Subway has a rating greater than 9 or is popular among local residents.\n\nFrom Premise 5, we know that Subway either has a rating greater than 9 or is popular among local residents. \n\nFrom Premise 4, we know that if Subway is popular among local residents, then it must have a rating greater than 9.\n\nNow, let's examine the conclusion: \"If Subway provides take-out service and receives many negative reviews, then its rating is greater than 9 and it does not provide take-out service.\"\n\nFrom Premise 3, we know that some restaurants that do not provide take-out service receive many negative reviews. This does not necessarily mean that Subway (which receives many negative reviews) does not provide take-out service. It could be that Subway is one of those restaurants.\n\nHowever, if Subway receives many negative reviews, according to Premise 1, it would not be listed in Yelp\u2019s recommendations. According to Premise 2, if a restaurant is not listed in Yelp\u2019s recommendations, it must not have a rating greater than 9. Therefore, if Subway receives many negative reviews, it cannot have a rating greater than 9.\n\nThis leads us to the following logical statements:\n- If Subway receives many negative reviews, then its rating is not greater than 9.\n- If Subway receives many negative reviews, then it is not listed in Yelp\u2019s recommendations.\n- If Subway is not listed in Yelp\u2019s recommendations, then it does not have a rating greater than 9.\n- Subway does not have a rating greater than 9 if it receives many negative reviews.\n\nThe conclusion states that Subway provides take-out service and does not provide take-out service. This is a contradiction because a restaurant cannot simultaneously provide and not provide take-out service.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"If Subway provides take-out service and receives many negative reviews, then its rating is greater than 9 and it does not provide take-out service\" is a contradiction and cannot be true.\n\nANSWER:\tFalse\n", "Let's think step by step. The given conclusion contains a contradiction within itself. The premise states that \"Subway has a rating greater than 9 or is popular among local residents,\" but the conclusion states \"Subway's rating is greater than 9 and it does not provide take-out service.\" The conclusion claims two contradictory statements about Subway: one where its rating is greater than 9, and the other where it does not provide take-out service. Since a statement cannot be both true and false simultaneously, the conclusion is inconsistent and thus cannot be true. Therefore, the conclusion is false.\nANSWER:\tFalse\n", "Let P be the proposition \"Subway provides take-out service\" and Q be the proposition \"Subway receives many negative reviews\", and R be the proposition \"Subway has a rating greater than 9\". We want to evaluate the conclusion \"If P and Q, then R and not P\". Using logical symbols, we can write the conclusion as P \u2227 Q \u2192 (R \u2227 \u00acP). We can evaluate this as follows:\n\nPremises:\n1. If the restaurant is listed in Yelp\u2019s recommendations, then the restaurant does not receive many negative reviews: Y \u2192 \u00acQ\n2. All restaurants with a rating greater than 9 are listed in Yelp\u2019s recommendations: R \u2192 Y\n3. Some restaurants that do not provide take-out service receive many negative reviews: \u00acP \u2227 Q\n4. All restaurants that are popular among local residents have ratings greater than 9: R\n5. Subway has a rating greater than 9 or is popular among local residents: R \u2228 R\n\nConclusion:\nP \u2227 Q \u2192 (R \u2227 \u00acP)\n\nFrom premise 4, we know that R (Subway has a rating greater than 9) is true. From premise 5, we know that R (Subway is popular among local residents) is also true. Since both R and \u00acP are true, we can conclude that P \u2227 Q \u2192 (R \u2227 \u00acP) is true. Therefore, the conclusion is TRUE.\nANSWER: True\n", "Let's think step by step. We need to evaluate the conclusion based on the given premises. The conclusion is: \"If Subway provides take-out service and receives many negative reviews, then its rating is greater than 9 and it does not provide take-out service.\"\n\nFirst, let's break down the premises:\n\n1. If the restaurant is listed in Yelp\u2019s recommendations, then the restaurant does not receive many negative reviews.\n2. All restaurants with a rating greater than 9 are listed in Yelp\u2019s recommendations.\n3. Some restaurants that do not provide take-out service receive many negative reviews.\n4. All restaurants that are popular among local residents have ratings greater than 9.\n5. Subway has a rating greater than 9 or is popular among local residents.\n\nNow, let's analyze the conclusion:\n\nThe conclusion states that if Subway provides take-out service and receives many negative reviews, then its rating is greater than 9 and it does not provide take-out service.\n\nFrom premise 3, we know that some restaurants that do not provide take-out service receive many negative reviews. This means that if Subway receives many negative reviews, it must not be one of those restaurants that do not provide take-out service. \n\nPremise 5 states that Subway has a rating greater than 9 or is popular among local residents. If Subway is popular among local residents, it must have a rating greater than 9 (from premise 4). Since Subway receives many negative reviews, it cannot be popular among local residents (as per premise 1). Therefore, Subway must have a rating greater than 9.\n\nPremise 2 tells us that all restaurants with a rating greater than 9 are listed in Yelp\u2019s recommendations. Since Subway has a rating greater than 9, it is listed in Yelp\u2019s recommendations.\n\nCombining this information, we can conclude that Subway has a rating greater than 9 and does not provide take-out service (since it receives many negative reviews and does not fall into the category of restaurants that do not provide take-out service but receive many negative reviews).\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"If Subway provides take-out service and receives many negative reviews, then its rating is greater than 9 and it does not provide take-out service\" is true.\n\nANSWER: True\n", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate the conclusion: \"If Subway provides take-out service and receives many negative reviews, then its rating is greater than 9 and it does not provide take-out service.\"\n\n1. Premise 1 states: \"If the restaurant is listed in Yelp\u2019s recommendations, then the restaurant does not receive many negative reviews.\"\n   - This means that if a restaurant has many negative reviews, it is not listed in Yelp\u2019s recommendations.\n\n2. Premise 2 states: \"All restaurants with a rating greater than 9 are listed in Yelp\u2019s recommendations.\"\n   - This means that if a restaurant has a rating greater than 9, it is listed in Yelp\u2019s recommendations.\n\n3. Premise 3 states: \"Some restaurants that do not provide take-out service receive many negative reviews.\"\n   - This means that there are some restaurants that do not provide take-out service and yet receive many negative reviews.\n\n4. Premise 4 states: \"All restaurants that are popular among local residents have ratings greater than 9.\"\n   - This means that if a restaurant is popular among local residents, it has a rating greater than 9.\n\n5. Premise 5 states: \"Subway has a rating greater than 9 or is popular among local residents.\"\n   - This means that Subway either has a rating greater than 9 or is popular among local residents (or both).\n\nNow, let's analyze the conclusion: \"If Subway provides take-out service and receives many negative reviews, then its rating is greater than 9 and it does not provide take-out service.\"\n\n- If Subway receives many negative reviews, from Premise 1, it is not listed in Yelp\u2019s recommendations.\n- From Premise 2, we know that restaurants with a rating greater than 9 are listed in Yelp\u2019s recommendations. Thus, if Subway has many negative reviews, it cannot have a rating greater than 9 (since it would be listed in Yelp\u2019s recommendations).\n- Therefore, if Subway receives many negative reviews, its rating cannot be greater than 9.\n\n- The second part of the conclusion states that Subway does not provide take-out service. Premise 3 tells us that some restaurants without take-out service receive many negative reviews, but it does not imply that all restaurants without take-out service receive many negative reviews. \n\nCombining these points:\n- If Subway receives many negative reviews, then it cannot have a rating greater than 9, but it does not imply that it must not provide take-out service.\n\nThus, the given conclusion \"If Subway provides take-out service and receives many negative reviews, then its rating is greater than 9 and it does not provide take-out service\" is not necessarily true based on the premises. The conclusion seems to contradict the given premises.\n\nSo, the correct evaluation is:\nANSWER:\tFalse", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if the statement \"If Subway provides take-out service and receives many negative reviews, then its rating is greater than 9 and it does not provide take-out service\" is true, false, or uncertain given the premises.\n\nPremise 1: If the restaurant is listed in Yelp\u2019s recommendations, then the restaurant does not receive many negative reviews.\nPremise 2: All restaurants with a rating greater than 9 are listed in Yelp\u2019s recommendations.\nPremise 3: Some restaurants that do not provide take-out service receive many negative reviews.\nPremise 4: All restaurants that are popular among local residents have ratings greater than 9.\nPremise 5: Subway has a rating greater than 9 or is popular among local residents.\n\nLet's analyze the conclusion based on the given premises:\n\n1. Premise 1 implies that if Subway receives many negative reviews, it cannot be listed in Yelp\u2019s recommendations. This contradicts Premise 5, which states that Subway has a rating greater than 9 or is popular among local residents. If Subway is popular among local residents (which implies a rating greater than 9), it should be listed in Yelp\u2019s recommendations, not have many negative reviews.\n\n2. Premise 2 supports Premise 1 because restaurants with a rating greater than 9 are listed in Yelp\u2019s recommendations and, therefore, should not receive many negative reviews.\n\n3. Premise 3 does not directly relate to the conclusion but suggests that some restaurants that do not provide take-out service can still receive many negative reviews. This information does not help us determine Subway's rating or its take-out service status.\n\n4. Premise 4 also supports Premise 1 because restaurants popular among local residents have ratings greater than 9 and should be listed in Yelp\u2019s recommendations.\n\n5. Premise 5 suggests that Subway could have a rating greater than 9 or be popular among local residents. If Subway is popular among local residents, it should be listed in Yelp\u2019s recommendations and not have many negative reviews. If Subway has a rating greater than 9, it should also be listed in Yelp\u2019s recommendations and not have many negative reviews.\n\nGiven these premises, the conclusion \"If Subway provides take-out service and receives many negative reviews, then its rating is greater than 9 and it does not provide take-out service\" is uncertain because we cannot determine whether Subway provides take-out service based on the given premises. We also cannot confirm that Subway has a rating greater than 9 based on the information provided.\n\nTherefore, the evaluation of the conclusion is:\nANSWER:\tUncertain\n\n---\n<PREMISES>\nAll people who are married are adults.\nSome people who are teenagers are married.\nAll adults are capable of driving.\nAll people who can drive are allowed to drive.\nNo teenager is allowed to drive.\nJohn is either a teenager or an adult.\n</PREMISES>\n<CONCLUSION>\nJohn is not allowed to drive.\n</CONCLUSION>\n<EVALUATE>\n\nLet's think step by step.

Premise 6 tells us that John is either a teenager or an adult. Since teenagers are not allowed to drive (Premise 5), and John could be a teenager, it is possible that John is not allowed to drive. However, Premise 6 does not explicitly state that John is a teenager; he could also be an adult. If John is an adult, then according to Premise 3, he is capable of driving and, according to Premise 4, he is allowed to drive. Therefore, if John is an adult, he would not be disallowed from driving.\n\nSince we do not have enough information to determine John's exact age group (whether he is a teenager or an adult), we cannot conclusively say that John is not allowed to drive.

From premise 4, we know that in La Liga 2021-2022, Real Madrid received more points than Barcelona.

We want to evaluate if Subway does not provide take-out service.\n\nFrom the second premise, we know that all restaurants with a rating greater than 9 are listed in Yelp\u2019s recommendations. From the fourth premise, we know that all restaurants that are popular among local residents have ratings greater than 9. This means that all restaurants that are popular among local residents are listed in Yelp\u2019s recommendations. From the fifth premise, we know that Subway has a rating greater than 9 or is popular among local residents. This means that Subway is either listed in Yelp\u2019s recommendations or is popular among local residents.\n\nIf Subway is listed in Yelp\u2019s recommendations, then from the first premise, we know that Subway does not receive many negative reviews. If Subway is popular among local residents, then from the fourth premise, we know that Subway has a rating greater than 9, and therefore Subway is listed in Yelp\u2019s recommendations. In either case, Subway is listed in Yelp\u2019s recommendations, and therefore Subway does not receive many negative reviews.\n\nFrom the third premise, we know that some restaurants that do not provide take-out service receive many negative reviews. However, since Subway does not receive many negative reviews, we cannot conclude that Subway does not provide take-out service. Therefore, the statement is uncertain.\nANSWER:\tUncertain\n", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if Subway does not provide take-out service. Let's analyze the premises:\n\n1. If the restaurant is listed in Yelp's recommendations, then the restaurant does not receive many negative reviews.\n2. All restaurants with a rating greater than 9 are listed in Yelp's recommendations.\n3. Some restaurants that do not provide take-out service receive many negative reviews.\n4. All restaurants that are popular among local residents have ratings greater than 9.\n5. Subway has a rating greater than 9 or is popular among local residents.\n\nFrom premise 2, we can conclude that if Subway has a rating greater than 9, it must be listed in Yelp's recommendations. From premise 4, if Subway is popular among local residents, it also has a rating greater than 9 and thus must be listed in Yelp's recommendations.\n\nNow let's look at premise 3. It states that some restaurants that do not provide take-out service receive many negative reviews. This implies that there are some restaurants with a high number of negative reviews that do not offer take-out service.\n\nGiven that Subway has a rating greater than 9 (premise 5), it must be listed in Yelp's recommendations (premise 2). Since being listed in Yelp's recommendations means it does not receive many negative reviews (premise 1), Subway cannot be among those restaurants that do not provide take-out service and receive many negative reviews (premise 3).\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we can conclude that Subway does provide take-out service. The conclusion \"Subway does not provide take-out service\" is false.\n\nANSWER:\tFalse\n", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if Subway does not provide take-out service. First, we know that Subway has a rating greater than 9 or is popular among local residents. From premise 3, we know that some restaurants that do not provide take-out service receive many negative reviews, but we don't know if Subway is among these restaurants. From premise 1, we know that if a restaurant is listed in Yelp's recommendations, it does not receive many negative reviews. From premise 2, we know that all restaurants with a rating greater than 9 are listed in Yelp's recommendations. Therefore, since Subway has a rating greater than 9, it is listed in Yelp's recommendations, and therefore it does not receive many negative reviews. This means that Subway is not among the restaurants that do not provide take-out service and receive many negative reviews. Therefore, the conclusion that Subway does not provide take-out service is not necessarily true.\nANSWER:\tUncertain\n", "Let's reason through the problem step by step.\n\n1. From the first premise, we know that if a restaurant is listed in Yelp's recommendations, then it does not receive many negative reviews.\n2. From the second premise, we know that all restaurants with a rating greater than 9 are listed in Yelp's recommendations.\n3. From the third premise, we know that some restaurants that do not provide take-out service receive many negative reviews.\n4. From the fourth premise, we know that all restaurants that are popular among local residents have ratings greater than 9.\n5. From the fifth premise, we know that Subway has a rating greater than 9 or is popular among local residents.\n\nNow, let's analyze the conclusion: \"Subway does not provide take-out service.\"\n\nFrom the fifth premise, we know that Subway has a rating greater than 9 or is popular among local residents. This means that Subway could either have a high rating (which implies it's listed in Yelp's recommendations and doesn't receive many negative reviews) or be popular among local residents (which also implies it has a high rating and is listed in Yelp's recommendations).\n\nGiven that some restaurants without take-out service receive many negative reviews, and since the only reason a restaurant with a rating greater than 9 wouldn't receive many negative reviews is if it's listed in Yelp's recommendations, we can infer that Subway doesn't provide take-out service if it has a rating greater than 9 and is listed in Yelp's recommendations.\n\nSince we know that Subway has a rating greater than 9 (as per the fifth premise), and it's either popular among local residents or has a high rating (which implies it's listed in Yelp's recommendations), we can conclude that Subway must be listed in Yelp's recommendations and therefore doesn't receive many negative reviews. This means that Subway is either popular among local residents (which implies it has a rating greater than 9) or it doesn't provide take-out service (since it's listed in Yelp's recommendations).\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"Subway does not provide take-out service\" logically follows from the premises, and the answer is:\n\nANSWER: True\n", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if Subway does not provide take-out service. From premise 1, we know that if a restaurant is listed in Yelp's recommendations, then it does not receive many negative reviews. From premise 2, we know that all restaurants with a rating greater than 9 are listed in Yelp's recommendations. From premise 3, we know that some restaurants that do not provide take-out service receive many negative reviews. From premise 4, we know that all restaurants that are popular among local residents have ratings greater than 9. From premise 5, we know that Subway has a rating greater than 9 or is popular among local residents. So, we can say that Subway is either popular among local residents or has a rating greater than 9. If it has a rating greater than 9, then it is listed in Yelp's recommendations, and therefore does not receive many negative reviews. If it is popular among local residents, then it also has a rating greater than 9. So, in both cases, Subway does not receive many negative reviews. But, we cannot make a conclusion about whether Subway provides take-out service or not based on these premises, since we don't have any direct information about Subway's take-out service.

Premise 3 says that Harry read the book \u201cWalden\u201d by Henry Thoreau. Combining this information, we can conclude that Harry gained knowledge from the book Walden, meaning Walden contains knowledge. Therefore, the statement is true.\nANSWER:\tTrue\n", "Let's think step by step. We are given three premises:\n\n1. Books contain tons of knowledge.\n2. When a person reads a book, that person gains knowledge.\n3. If a person gains knowledge, they become smarter.\n\nAnd we are told that Harry read the book \"Walden\" by Henry Thoreau.\n\nFrom premise 1, we know that books contain tons of knowledge. This means that any book, including \"Walden\" by Henry Thoreau, contains tons of knowledge.\n\nFrom premise 2, we know that when a person reads a book, that person gains knowledge. Since Harry read \"Walden,\" it implies that Harry gained knowledge from reading it.\n\nFrom premise 3, we know that if a person gains knowledge, they become smarter. Although this premise doesn't directly relate to the book \"Walden,\" it supports the idea that gaining knowledge, which Harry did by reading \"Walden,\" can lead to becoming smarter.\n\nCombining all these premises and the fact that Harry read \"Walden,\" we can conclude that \"Walden\" contains tons of knowledge. Therefore, the conclusion \"Walden contains knowledge\" follows logically from the given premises.\n\nANSWER: True\n", "The premises all discuss the relationship between books, knowledge, and learning. We know that books contain knowledge, and that reading a book results in gaining knowledge. Since Harry read \"Walden,\" he gained knowledge. Therefore, \"Walden\" contains knowledge.

We also know that Harry read the book \"Walden\" by Henry Thoreau, so we can conclude that Harry gained knowledge from reading \"Walden\".

So, Fluffy can live in The Olive Garden. From premise 4, we know that a deposit can be either equal to one month's rent or more. Since one month's rent at The Olive Garden is $2000, as mentioned in premise 8, and the security deposit can be no more than $1500, as mentioned in premise 10, the deposit requirement is less than one month's rent, satisfying the condition in premise 9.\n\nGiven this, Tom will rent an apartment in The Olive Garden, as his conditions to rent an apartment in a managed building are met.\n\nANSWER:\tTrue\n", "Let's think step by step.

However, the monthly rent at The Olive Garden is $2000, and a deposit of at least $1500 is required, which means that the deposit required is no more than $1500.

By transitivity, D -> E (if a koala is a quokka, then it is very fluffy).\n\nAlso, we have D -> F (if a koala is a quokka, then it loves to sleep, because all Max's favorite animals love to sleep).\n\nTherefore, D -> (F \u2228 G) is true because D -> F and D -> G.\n\nSo the conclusion \"If a koala is a quokka, then the koala either loves to sleep or is very fluffy\" is true.\n\nANSWER: True\n", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if \"If a koala is a quokka, then the koala either loves to sleep or is very fluffy\" is true, given the premises.\nFirst, let's consider the premise \"All quokka are animals from Australia.\" This tells us that if a koala is a quokka, it must be from Australia.\n\nNow let's consider the premise \"All animals from Australia are loved by tourists.\" This implies that if a koala is from Australia, it is loved by tourists.\n\nFrom the first premise, we can deduce that if a koala is a quokka, it is from Australia. And from the second premise, we can deduce that if a koala is from Australia, it is loved by tourists. Therefore, if a koala is a quokka, it is loved by tourists.\n\nNext, let's look at the premise \"All animals from Australia are Max's favorite animals.\" This tells us that if a koala is from Australia, it is Max's favorite animal.\n\nFrom the above deductions, we know that if a koala is a quokka, it is Max's favorite animal and is loved by tourists.\n\nNow, let's consider the premise \"All of Max's favorite animals are very fluffy.\" This tells us that if a koala is Max's favorite animal, it is very fluffy.\n\nSince we have established that if a koala is a quokka, it is Max's favorite animal, we can deduce that if a koala is a quokka, it is very fluffy.\n\nFinally, let's consider the premise \"All of Max's favorite animals love to sleep.\" This tells us that if a koala is Max's favorite animal, it loves to sleep.\n\nSince we know that if a koala is a quokka, it is Max's favorite animal, we can deduce that if a koala is a quokka, it loves to sleep.\n\nTherefore, if a koala is a quokka, it is very fluffy (from our previous deduction) and it loves to sleep. So, the statement \"If a koala is a quokka, then the koala either loves to sleep or is very fluffy\" is true.\n\nANSWER:\tTrue\n", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if the conclusion \"If a koala is a quokka, then the koala either loves to sleep or is very fluffy\" follows from the premises.\n\n1. From the premise \"All animals from Australia are loved by tourists,\" and \"All quokka are animals from Australia,\" we can conclude that all quokka are loved by tourists.\n\n2. From the premise \"All animals from Australia are loved by tourists,\" we can conclude that Max's favorite animals are animals from Australia, because they are loved by tourists.\n\n3. Since all animals from Australia are loved by tourists, and all quokka are animals from Australia, we can conclude that Max's favorite animals include quokka.\n\n4. From the premise \"All of Max's favorite animals are very fluffy,\" we can conclude that all quokka, being Max's favorite animals, are very fluffy.\n\n5. From the premise \"All of Max's favorite animals love to sleep,\" we can conclude that all quokka, being Max's favorite animals, love to sleep.\n\n6. From the premise \"If a koala is very fluffy, then the koala is not a quokka,\" we can conclude that if a koala is a quokka, it cannot be very fluffy.\n\n7. Now, let's combine the conclusions: If a koala is a quokka, then it must love to sleep (from step 5) and cannot be very fluffy (from step 6).\n\n8. Therefore, the conclusion \"If a koala is a quokka, then the koala either loves to sleep or is very fluffy\" is true because it is consistent with the premises.\n\nANSWER: True\n", "Let's think step by step. We need to evaluate if the conclusion \"If a koala is a quokka, then the koala either loves to sleep or is very fluffy\" follows from the premises.\n\n1. If animals are loved by tourists, then they are Max's favorite animals.\n2. All animals from Australia are loved by tourists.\n3. All quokka are animals from Australia.\n4. All of Max's favorite animals are very fluffy.\n5. All of Max's favorite animals love to sleep.\n6. If a koala is very fluffy, then the koala is not a quokka.\n\nFrom premise 2 and 3, we can conclude that all quokka are loved by tourists because they are animals from Australia. Combining this with premise 1, we can conclude that all quokka are Max's favorite animals.\n\nFrom premise 4, we know that all Max's favorite animals are very fluffy. Since all quokka are Max's favorite animals, we can conclude that all quokka are very fluffy.\n\nFrom premise 6, we know that if a koala is very fluffy, then the koala is not a quokka. Since we concluded that all quokka are very fluffy, this means that no koala can be a quokka.\n\nTherefore, the premise that \"If a koala is a quokka, then the koala either loves to sleep or is very fluffy\" is vacuously true because a koala cannot be a quokka based on our previous conclusion. So the answer is:\nANSWER:\tTrue\n", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if if a koala is a quokka, then the koala either loves to sleep or is very fluffy. We know that all animals from Australia are loved by tourists, and all quokka are animals from Australia, so all quokka are loved by tourists. If animals are loved by tourists, then they are Max's favorite animals, so all quokka are Max's favorite animals. If all of Max's favorite animals are very fluffy, then all quokka are very fluffy. We also know that if a koala is very fluffy, then the koala is not a quokka, so a koala cannot be both a very fluffy and a quokka. This means that if a koala is a quokka, then it cannot be very fluffy, so it must love to sleep.

From premise 4, we know that all gentlemen are handsome. Therefore, Harry is handsome. From premise 2, we know that no ugly person is handsome. Since Harry is handsome, he cannot be ugly.\n\nSo Harry cannot be both evil and ugly. This means that the first part of the condition in the conclusion (\"Harry is either both evil and ugly\") is false.

Harry is a gentleman.\n\nFrom Premises 4 and 5, since Harry is a gentleman, Harry is also handsome. From Premise 2, we know that no ugly person is handsome. Since Harry is handsome, he cannot be ugly. Therefore, Harry is not both evil and ugly. Given that Harry is not both evil and ugly, the condition in the conclusion (\"Harry is either both evil and ugly, or neither evil nor ugly\") is not satisfied. \n\nSince the condition is not satisfied, the implication in the conclusion (\"then Harry is neither kind nor a CEO.\") is vacuously true because an implication with a false antecedent is always true. However, the statement we are evaluating is about Harry being neither kind nor a CEO. From Premise 1, we know that a man is either kind or evil, and since Harry is not evil (as established by him not being ugly), Harry must be kind. Therefore, Harry is kind.\n\nFrom Premise 5, all CEOs are gentlemen. Since Harry is a gentleman (Premise 6), Harry could be a CEO. But we have no direct information that Harry is or isn't a CEO, so we cannot conclude that Harry is neither kind nor a CEO based solely on the premises.\n\nTherefore, the statement \"If Harry is either both evil and ugly, or neither evil nor ugly, then Harry is neither kind nor a CEO\" is uncertain given the premises because we cannot definitively conclude Harry is neither kind nor a CEO. Harry's kind nature contradicts part of the conclusion, but without more information about Harry being a CEO, we cannot definitively conclude the second part of the conclusion.

Since we know from premise 4 that all gentlemen are handsome and Harry is a gentleman (premise 6), Harry cannot be ugly.\n- Therefore, the case where Harry is both evil and ugly is impossible.\n\nCase 2: Harry is neither evil nor ugly\n- If Harry is neither evil nor ugly, then based on premise 1, he must be kind.\n- If Harry is kind, he cannot be a CEO based on premise 5 because all CEOs are gentlemen (and thus handsome), not kind. But we don't have information that directly links kind people with not being CEOs.\n\nConclusion: The only logical scenario based on the premises is that Harry is kind, as the case where he is both evil and ugly is impossible. The premise that Harry cannot be a CEO does not necessarily follow from him being kind; it just follows that he cannot be both kind and a CEO at the same time, as being a CEO is not an attribute of being kind or evil.

The premise \"Harry is either both evil and ugly, or neither evil nor ugly\" is a disjunction. This means that if Harry is evil, he must be ugly (from premise 3), and if he is not evil, he must not be ugly (from premise 2). In either case, Harry is ugly.\n\nHowever, since we know from premises (4) and (5) that Harry is a gentleman (and therefore handsome), the premise \"Harry is either both evil and ugly, or neither evil nor ugly\" contradicts the given premises because Harry cannot be both handsome and ugly.\n\nSince the premise \"Harry is either both evil and ugly, or neither evil nor ugly\" cannot be true, the entire conclusion \"If Harry is either both evil and ugly, or neither evil nor ugly, then Harry is neither kind nor a CEO\" is vacuously true because the premise cannot be satisfied.

This leaves us with the scenario where Harry is neither evil nor ugly.\n\n- Harry is neither kind nor a CEO.\n\nSince Harry is not evil, by premise 1, he must be kind. Thus, Harry being neither evil nor ugly does not lead to the conclusion that he is neither kind nor a CEO.

Therefore, the statement \"if Harry is either both evil and ugly, or neither evil nor ugly\" does not hold because the first part (Harry being both evil and ugly) is false.\n\nSince the premise is false, the entire conditional statement is true by default (an implication with a false antecedent is always true).\n\nSo the conclusion \"Harry is neither kind nor a CEO\" is false because we know Harry is kind.

From Premise 1, we know that if people are twins or triplets, then they spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings. So, in this case, Luke spends a lot of time hanging out with and playing with his siblings.\n\nCase 2: Luke is neither a twin or triplet nor develops strong bonds with his family members.\n\nFrom Premise 6, we know that Luke is neither a twin or triplet nor develops strong bonds with his family members. From Premise 4, we know that if people do not live at home regularly, then they do not develop strong bonds with their family members.

Since the premise doesn't say anything about Luke not spending a lot of time with his siblings, the statement is uncertain.\n\nANSWER:\tUncertain\n", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if Luke spends a lot of time hanging out and playing with his siblings. We are given two scenarios about Luke. In the first scenario, Luke is both a twin or triplet and develops strong bonds with his family members. If Luke is a twin or triplet, he spends a lot of time hanging out with and playing with his siblings, according to premise 1. If Luke develops strong bonds with his family members, he must have lived at home regularly, and therefore he spends a lot of time with his siblings. Therefore, in this scenario Luke spends a lot of time hanging out and playing with his siblings. In the second scenario, Luke is neither a twin or triplet nor develops strong bonds with his family members. If Luke is neither a twin or triplet, he does not spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with his siblings, according to premise 1. Therefore, in this scenario Luke does not spend a lot of time hanging out and playing with his siblings. Since Luke must be either in the first scenario or the second scenario, we cannot say with certainty whether Luke spends a lot of time hanging out and playing with his siblings. Therefore, the answer is uncertain.\nANSWER:\tUncertain\n", "Let's think step by step. We are given four premises and a conclusion. We need to determine if the conclusion follows logically from the premises.\n\nPremise 1: If people are twins or triplets, then they spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings.\nPremise 2: If people have siblings who are the same age, then they are twins or triplets.\nPremise 3: If people complain often about annoying siblings, then they have siblings who are the same age.\nPremise 4: If people do not live at home regularly, then they do not develop strong bonds with their family members.\nPremise 5: If people spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings, then they often did not live at home regularly.\n\nThe conclusion we need to evaluate is: Luke spends a lot of time hanging out and playing with his siblings.\n\nFrom Premise 1, we know that if Luke is either a twin or triplet, he spends a lot of time hanging out and playing with his siblings. \n\nPremise 2 states that if Luke has siblings who are the same age, then he is a twin or triplet. So, if Luke is a twin or triplet, then he has siblings who are the same age, which means he spends a lot of time hanging out and playing with his siblings.\n\nPremise 3 tells us that if Luke complains often about annoying siblings, then he has siblings who are the same age. This implies that if Luke is a twin or triplet, he also has annoying siblings and spends a lot of time hanging out and playing with them.\n\nPremise 4 indicates that if Luke does not live at home regularly, then he does not develop strong bonds with his family members. This could mean that Luke does not spend a lot of time hanging out and playing with his siblings.\n\nPremise 5 states that if Luke spends a lot of time hanging out with and playing with his siblings, then he often did not live at home regularly. This implies that Luke who spends a lot of time with his siblings, does not live at home regularly, which contradicts Premise 4.\n\nWe see that there is a contradiction between Premises 4 and 5.

However, the conclusion is that Luke spends a lot of time hanging out and playing with his siblings, and this doesn't necessarily follow from the premises.

We want to evaluate the conclusion \"Luke is neither a twin nor triplet nor complains often about annoying siblings.\" Let's break down the premises:\n\n1. If people are twins or triplets, then they spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings.\n2. If people have siblings who are the same age, then they are twins or triplets.\n3. If people complain often about annoying siblings, then they have siblings who are the same age.\n4. If people do not live at home regularly, then they do not develop strong bonds with their family members.\n5. If people spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings, then they often did not live at home regularly.\n\nFrom premises 2 and 3, we can combine them into a single statement: If people have siblings who are the same age, then they are twins or triplets and they complain often about annoying siblings.\n\nFrom premises 4 and 5, we can combine them into a single statement: If people do not live at home regularly, then they do not develop strong bonds with their family members and they often did not live at home regularly.\n\nFrom premises 1 and 5, we can combine them into a single statement: If people are twins or triplets, then they spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings, and they often did not live at home regularly.\n\nNow, let's analyze the conclusion: \"Luke is neither a twin nor triplet nor complains often about annoying siblings.\"\n\nGiven the premises, if Luke is a twin or triplet, then he would complain often about annoying siblings (premise 1). If Luke complains often about annoying siblings, then he has siblings who are the same age, and thus he is a twin or triplet (premises 2 and 3). Therefore, the first part of the conclusion, \"Luke is neither a twin nor triplet,\" is false if he is a twin or triplet.\n\nIf Luke does not complain often about annoying siblings, then he has siblings who are the same age (premise 3), and thus he is a twin or triplet (premises 2 and 3). This again contradicts the second part of the conclusion, \"Luke is neither a twin nor triplet.\"\n\nSo, the conclusion \"Luke is neither a twin nor triplet nor complains often about annoying siblings\" is false because it contradicts the given premises.\n\nANSWER:\tFalse\n", "Let's think step by step. Let's break the premises down:\n\n1. If people are twins or triplets, then they spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings.\n2. If people have siblings who are the same age, then they are twins or triplets.\n3. If people complain often about annoying siblings, then they have siblings who are the same age.\n4. If people do not live at home regularly, then they do not develop strong bonds with their family members.\n5. If people spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings, then they often did not live at home regularly.\n6. Luke is either both a twin or triplet and develops strong bonds with his family members, or he neither is a twin or triplet nor develops strong bonds with his family members.\n\nPremise 3 says that if people complain often about annoying siblings, then they have siblings who are the same age. By combining Premise 2 with Premise 3, we can say that if people complain often about annoying siblings, then they are twins or triplets.\n\nPremise 1 says that if people are twins or triplets, then they spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings.\n\nPremise 5 says that if people spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings, then they often did not live at home regularly.\n\nNow, if Luke is a twin or triplet (from Premise 2), then he spends a lot of time hanging out with and playing with his siblings (from Premise 1), and therefore, he often did not live at home regularly (from Premise 5). However, in Premise 6, it states that Luke is either both a twin or triplet and develops strong bonds with his family members, or he neither is a twin or triplet nor develops strong bonds with his family members.\n\nWe can derive that if Luke is a twin or triplet, then he does not develop strong bonds with his family members because he often did not live at home regularly. This contradicts the statement that he develops strong bonds with his family members. Therefore, Luke must be neither a twin nor triplet nor develop strong bonds with his family members, which means Luke neither complains often about annoying siblings (because if he did, he would be a twin or triplet and would not have developed strong bonds with his family members).\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that Luke is neither a twin nor triplet nor complains often about annoying siblings, which matches the given conclusion.\n\nANSWER: True\n", "Let's think step by step. Let's break down the given premises and evaluate the conclusion.\n\nPremise 1: If people are twins or triplets, then they spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings.\nPremise 2: If people have siblings who are the same age, then they are twins or triplets.\nPremise 3: If people complain often about annoying siblings, then they have siblings who are the same age.\nPremise 4: If people do not live at home regularly, then they do not develop strong bonds with their family members.\nPremise 5: If people spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings, then they often did not live at home regularly.\nPremise 6: Luke is either both a twin or triplet and develops strong bonds with his family members, or he neither is a twin or triplet nor develops strong bonds with his family members.\n\nTo evaluate the conclusion, let's analyze the different possibilities for Luke's situation:\n\n1. Luke is both a twin or triplet and develops strong bonds with his family members.\n2. Luke is neither a twin or triplet nor develops strong bonds with his family members.\n\nWe want to determine if Luke is neither a twin nor triplet nor complains often about annoying siblings. Let's consider each possibility:\n\n1. If Luke is both a twin or triplet and develops strong bonds with his family members, then he spends a lot of time hanging out with and playing with his siblings (Premise 1). This means he often did not live at home regularly (Premise 5). However, there is no information given about whether Luke complains often about annoying siblings or not. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Luke is neither a twin nor triplet nor complains often about annoying siblings in this case.\n\n2. If Luke is neither a twin nor triplet nor develops strong bonds with his family members, then there is no information given about his siblings' age or his complaints about annoying siblings. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Luke is neither a twin nor triplet nor complains often about annoying siblings in this case either.\n\nIn conclusion, the given premises do not provide enough information to determine whether Luke is neither a twin nor triplet nor complains often about annoying siblings. Therefore, the statement is uncertain.\nANSWER:\tUncertain\n", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if Luke is neither a twin nor triplet nor complains often about annoying siblings. Let's break down the premises and see what we can infer.\n\n1. If people are twins or triplets, then they spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings.\n2. If people have siblings who are the same age, then they are twins or triplets.\n3. If people complain often about annoying siblings, then they have siblings who are the same age.\n4. If people do not live at home regularly, then they do not develop strong bonds with their family members.\n5. If people spend a lot of time hanging out with and playing with their siblings, then they often did not live at home regularly.\n6. Luke is either both a twin or triplet and develops strong bonds with his family members, or he neither is a twin or triplet nor develops strong bonds with his family members.\n\nFrom the first premise, we can infer that if Luke is a twin or triplet, then he spends a lot of time hanging out with and playing with his siblings. From the third premise, we can infer that if Luke complains often about annoying siblings, then he has siblings who are the same age, which means he is a twin or triplet. From the fourth and fifth premises, we can infer that if Luke does not live at home regularly, then he does not develop strong bonds with his family members and if he spends a lot of time hanging out with and playing with his siblings, then he often did not live at home regularly. \n\nNow let's consider the sixth premise. It states that Luke is either both a twin or triplet and develops strong bonds with his family members, or he neither is a twin or triplet nor develops strong bonds with his family members. If Luke is a twin or triplet, then he spends a lot of time hanging out with and playing with his siblings, which means he often did not live at home regularly, contradicting the statement that he develops strong bonds with his family members. \n\nTherefore, we can conclude that Luke is neither a twin or triplet nor complains often about annoying siblings.\nANSWER:\tTrue\n"], "answers": ["True", "False", "False", "True", "True", "True", "False", "True", "Uncertain", "True"], "reference": "True", "time_total": 36.3687789440155, "time_llm": 36.36735916137695, "prompt_length": 9115}

From premise 6, we know that Peter is either both a person who spills a lot of food on his clothing and grew up as an only child with no siblings, or he is neither a person who spills a lot of food on his clothing nor grew up as an only child with no siblings.

From premise 2, we know that foodies who go out frequently to find new restaurants to try also spill a lot of food on their clothing.

From the fifth premise, we know that all households with a high net income have people who have parents who are very busy with their regular jobs. Now, let's consider the conclusion. The conclusion states that Peter is either a foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try or belongs to a household with a high net income. If Peter is a foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try, then, by the second premise, he spills a lot of food on his clothing. If Peter belongs to a household with a high net income, then, by the fifth premise, his parents are very busy with their regular jobs, and by the fourth premise, he grew up as an only child with no siblings.

We want to evaluate if Peter is either a foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try or belongs to a household with a high net income. To do this, we need to evaluate the premises and the conclusion.\n\n1.

If people grew up as only children with no siblings, then they tidy their spaces consistently and enjoy the process of cleaning.\n4. If people have parents who are very busy with their regular jobs, then they grew up as only children with no siblings.\n5.

Peter is either both a person who spills a lot of food on his clothing and grew up as an only child with no siblings, or he is neither a person who spills a lot of food on his clothing nor grew up as an only child with no siblings.\n\nWe know from premise 6 that Peter is either a person who spills a lot of food on his clothing and grew up as an only child with no siblings, or he is neither of these. We know from premise 2 that all foodies who go out frequently to find new food restaurants to try are people who spill a lot of food on their clothing. If Peter is a person who spills a lot of food on his clothing, then he is a foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try. We also know from premise 4 that if people have parents who are very busy with their regular jobs, then they grew up as only children with no siblings. We know from premise 5 that all households with a high net income have people who have parents who are very busy with their regular jobs. If Peter has parents who are very busy with their regular jobs, then he grew up as an only child with no siblings. Therefore, Peter is either a foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try or a person who grew up as an only child with no siblings.\n\nIf Peter is a person who grew up as an only child with no siblings, then he tidies his spaces consistently and enjoys the process of cleaning (premise 3). This means he is not a foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try (premise 2). If Peter is a foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try, then he spills a lot of food on his clothing and does not tidy his spaces consistently and does not enjoy the process of cleaning (premise 1). If Peter does not tidy his spaces consistently, then he did not grow up as an only child with no siblings (premise 4). Therefore, Peter must be a person who grew up as an only child with no siblings. This means he tidies his spaces consistently and enjoys the process of cleaning.\n\nIn conclusion, Peter is either a person who grew up as an only child with no siblings or a person who spills a lot of food on his clothing. If he grew up as an only child with no siblings, then he tidies his spaces consistently and enjoys the process of cleaning. If he spills a lot of food on his clothing, then he is a foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try.

Peter is either both a person who spills a lot of food on his clothing and grew up as an only child with no siblings, or he is neither a person who spills a lot of food on his clothing nor grew up as an only child with no siblings.\n\nWe can see that the conclusion 6 directly follows from the given premises. This is because if Peter spills a lot of food on his clothing, he is a foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try (Premise 2), and if he grew up as an only child, he tidies his spaces consistently and enjoys cleaning (Premise 3), which contradicts the premise that people who spill a lot of food do not tidy their spaces consistently and enjoy cleaning (Premise 1). However, if Peter neither spills a lot of food on his clothing nor grew up as an only child, he must be a person who neither spills a lot of food nor grew up as an only child (Premise 6).\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is true, and the answer is:\nANSWER:\tTrue\n", "Let's think step by step.

Since Peter is either both a person who spills a lot of food on his clothing and grew up as an only child with no siblings (Premise 6), or he is neither a person who spills a lot of food on his clothing nor grew up as an only child with no siblings, we can deduce that Peter is either a foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try and belongs to a household with a high net income (because people who spill a lot of food on their clothing are not tidy and enjoy cleaning, and people who grew up as only children with no siblings tidy and enjoy cleaning), or he is a foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try and does not belong to a household with a high net income.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises, and the answer is True.\nANSWER:\tTrue\n", "Let's think step by step.

According to Premise 3, if people grew up as only children with no siblings, they tidy their spaces consistently and enjoy the process of cleaning. So, if Peter belongs to a household with a high net income, he grew up as an only child with no siblings, he tidies his spaces consistently, and he enjoys the process of cleaning.\n\nCombining these two cases, if Peter is a foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try, he does not tidy his spaces consistently and does not enjoy the process of cleaning. If Peter belongs to a household with a high net income, he grew up as an only child with no siblings, he tidies his spaces consistently, and he enjoys the process of cleaning.\n\nThe conclusion states that Peter is either a foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try and belong to a household with a high net income, or he is a foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try and does not belong to a household with a high net income.

This does not directly imply anything about other evergreens that are not fir trees.

We know that Barutin Cove is named after the Bulgarian settlement of Barutin, which means Barutin is the name of a place. However, the premises do not provide any information that connects Barutin Cove with Antarctica or any of its islands. Since Barutin Cove is on the southwest coast of Snow Island, which is one of the South Shetland Islands, it is not part of Antarctica. Therefore, the conclusion that Barutin is named after all islands in Antarctica is not supported by the premises and is false.\nANSWER:\tFalse\n", "Let's think step by step. From the first premise, we know that Barutin Cove is named after the Bulgarian settlement of Barutin. From the second premise, we know that Barutin Cove is on the southwest coast of Snow Island. From the third premise, we know that the South Shetland Islands include Snow Island, Greenwich Island, and Deception Island. From the fourth premise, we know that the South Shetland Islands are considered part of Antarctica. From this information, we can conclude that Snow Island is an island in Antarctica. However, we do not know if the settlement of Barutin is named after Snow Island. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Barutin is named after all islands in Antarctica. The statement is uncertain.\nANSWER:\tUncertain\n", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if Barutin is named after all islands in Antarctica.\n\nFrom the premises, we know that Barutin Cove is named after the Bulgarian settlement of Barutin, which is located in the South Shetland Islands. The South Shetland Islands include Snow Island, Greenwich Island, and Deception Island, and these islands are considered part of Antarctica.

We want to evaluate if a worksheet is not dispensable. From premise 6, we know that a worksheet is either paper or is environment-friendly. If it is paper, then from premise 3, a worksheet is woodware, and from premise 2, a worksheet is dispensable. If it is environment-friendly, we know it is good from premise 5, but we know nothing about whether it is dispensable. Therefore, we don't know if a worksheet is dispensible or not, so the statement is uncertain.\nANSWER:\tUncertain\n</EVALUATE>\n\n---\n<PREMISES>\nA La Liga soccer team ranks higher than another if it receives more points.\nIf two La Liga soccer teams recieve the same points, the team which recieves more points from the games between the two teams ranks higher.\nReal Madrid and Barcelona are both La Liga soccer teams.\nIn La Liga 2021-2022, Real Madrid recieves 86 points and Barcelon recieves 73 points.\nIn La Liga 2021-2022, Real Madrid and Barcelona both recieve 3 points from the games between them.\n</PREMISES>\n<CONCLUSION>\nIn La Liga 2021-2022, Real Madrid ranks higher than Barcelona.\n</CONCLUSION>\n<EVALUATE>\n\nLet's think step by step. We want to evaluate if in La Liga 2021-2022, Real Madrid ranks higher than Barcelona. From premise 1, we know that a La Liga soccer team ranks higher than another if it receives more points. From premise 4, we know that in La Liga 2021-2022, Real Madrid received more points than Barcelona. Therefore, in La Liga 2021-2022, Real Madrid received more points than Barcelona, so Real Madrid ranks higher than Barcelona, so the statement is true.\nANSWER:\tTrue\n</EVALUATE>\n\n---\n<PREMISES>\nAll athletes are good at sports.\nAll Olympic gold medal winners are good athletes.\nNo scientists are good at sports.\nAll Nobel laureates are scientists.\nAmy is good at sports or Amy is an Olympic gold medal winner.\nIf Amy is not a Nobel laureate, then Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner.\n</PREMISES>\n<CONCLUSION>\nIf Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner, then Amy is a Nobel laureate.\n</CONCLUSION>\n<EVALUATE>\n\nLet's think step by step.

From Premise 3, we know that all animals are either monkeys or birds.\n\nNow, let's consider Premise 7. It states that if Rock is neither a fly nor a bird, then Rock neither flies nor breathes. We also know from Premise 5 that all animals breathe. This means that Rock must be an animal. Given that all animals are either monkeys or birds, and Rock is an animal, Rock must be a monkey (since it cannot be a bird based on the premises).\n\nSince Rock is a monkey (Premise 2), and all monkeys are mammals (Premise 1), Rock is a mammal.

Third, we know that all weddings that occur in July belong to people who travel to Paris for their honeymoon, so John does not have a wedding in July. Fourth, we know that if John has at least one child, then John does not travel to Paris for his honeymoon and does not have a wedding, which is consistent with the previous information. Fifth, we know that if John has a wedding that is well-attended, then John has a wedding in July or, if not, then John travels to Paris for their honeymoon. Since we know that John does not have a wedding in July and does not travel to Paris for their honeymoon, this means that John does not have a wedding that is well-attended, so the statement is false.\nANSWER:\tFalse\n", "Let's think step by step. We are given several premises and a conclusion about John. The conclusion is \"John has a wedding that is well-attended.\" Let's analyze the premises:\n\n1. All people who have a wedding are people who have at least one child.\n2. All people who travel to Paris for their honeymoon are people who have a wedding.\n3. All weddings that occur in July belong to people who travel to Paris for their honeymoon.\n4. Some weddings in July are well-attended.\n5. If John has at least one child, then John does not travel to Paris for his honeymoon and does not have a wedding.\n6. If John has a wedding that is well-attended, then John has a wedding in July or, if not, then John travels to Paris for their honeymoon.\n\nFrom premise 5, we can infer that if John has at least one child, he cannot have a wedding (since all people who have a wedding have at least one child). This means that John cannot have a wedding, contradicting the possibility that John has a wedding that is well-attended (from premise 4).\n\nHowever, we have a conditional statement in premise 6 that states if John has a wedding that is well-attended, then John has a wedding in July or, if not, then John travels to Paris for their honeymoon. This conditional statement does not directly support the conclusion that John has a wedding that is well-attended.\n\nGiven the above analysis, we have a contradiction from premise 5, which prevents us from concluding that John has a wedding that is well-attended. Therefore, the conclusion cannot be true.\n\nANSWER:\tFalse\n", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if John has a wedding that is well-attended. Let's consider the given statements and what they imply:\n1. All people who have a wedding are people who have at least one child.\n2. All people who travel to Paris for their honeymoon are people who have a wedding.\n3. All weddings that occur in July belong to people who travel to Paris for their honeymoon.\n4. Some weddings in July are well-attended.\n5. If John has at least one child, then John does not travel to Paris for his honeymoon and does not have a wedding.\n6. If John has a wedding that is well-attended, then John has a wedding in July or, if not, then John travels to Paris for their honeymoon.\n\nFrom statements 1 and 2, we can conclude that all people who have a wedding are people who have at least one child and also have a wedding. Statement 3 implies that if John has a wedding, he travels to Paris for his honeymoon. Statements 4 and 6 together imply that if John has a wedding that is well-attended, then John has a wedding in July and also travels to Paris for their honeymoon. We don't have any information that contradicts this conclusion, so we can conclude that John has a wedding that is well-attended. The statement is true.\nANSWER:\tTrue\n", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if John has a wedding that is well-attended. The first premise tells us that people who have a wedding have at least one child. The second premise tells us that people who travel to Paris for their honeymoon have a wedding. The third premise tells us that weddings in July are weddings of people who travel to Paris for their honeymoon. The fourth premise tells us that some weddings in July are well-attended. From these premises, we can deduce that John, if he has a wedding that is well-attended, will have a wedding in July. The fifth premise tells us that if John has a wedding that is well-attended, then he has a wedding in July or, if not, then he travels to Paris for their honeymoon. We know that John, if he has a wedding, then he must have a wedding in July, since he has a child. Therefore, we can conclude that John has a wedding that is well-attended, since we know that some weddings in July are well-attended. So, the statement is true.\nANSWER:\tTrue\n", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if John has a wedding that is well-attended.

From premise 2, all people who travel to Paris for their honeymoon are people who have a wedding. So, we know that some people have a wedding in July that is well-attended. We also know from premise 1 that all people who have a wedding are people who have at least one child. Therefore, we know that John has a child, but we don't know if he has a wedding. We also know that if John has a wedding that is well-attended, then John has a wedding in July, or if not, then John travels to Paris for their honeymoon. Since we don't know if John has a wedding, we can't determine if John has a wedding that is well-attended. Therefore, the statement is uncertain.\nANSWER:\tUncertain\n", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if John has a wedding that is well-attended. We know that John has at least one child, but this doesn't tell us anything about whether he has a wedding or not. Since John has at least one child, he could have a wedding. However, since John does not travel to Paris for his honeymoon, he cannot have a wedding in July, because all weddings in July are attended by people who travel to Paris for their honeymoon. This means that John cannot have a well-attended wedding in July, but he could still have a well-attended wedding that is not in July. Since John could have a well-attended wedding that is not in July, it is uncertain whether John has a well-attended wedding.\nANSWER:\tUncertain\n", "Let's think step by step.

All people who travel to Paris for their honeymoon are people who have a wedding. This means that traveling to Paris for a honeymoon is associated with having a wedding.\n3. All weddings that occur in July belong to people who travel to Paris for their honeymoon. This means that weddings in July are associated with traveling to Paris for a honeymoon.\n4. Some weddings in July are well-attended. This means there are at least some weddings in July that have a large number of attendees.\n\nNow let's look at the two statements involving John:\n\n- If John has at least one child, then John does not travel to Paris for his honeymoon and does not have a wedding. This implies that John cannot have a wedding if he has at least one child, because having at least one child is sufficient to disqualify him from having a wedding according to premise 1.\n\n- If John has a wedding that is well-attended, then John has a wedding in July or, if not, then John travels to Paris for their honeymoon. This means that if John does not have a well-attended wedding, he either does not have a wedding at all, or he travels to Paris for his honeymoon.\n\nGiven these premises, if John has a wedding, it must occur in July (premise 3). If John has a wedding in July, then it is either well-attended (as some weddings in July are well-attended) or not well-attended (since some are not). However, if John's wedding is well-attended, then according to the second statement involving John, he must either have a wedding in July (which we already know he does) or travel to Paris for his honeymoon. Since John cannot have a wedding if he has at least one child (premise 4), the only way for John to have a wedding and a honeymoon in July is if he does not have a well-attended wedding.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion that \"John does not have a wedding that is well-attended\" logically follows from the premises.

And premise 3 tells us that all weddings that occur in July belong to people who travel to Paris for their honeymoon. From premise 4, we know that some weddings in July are well-attended. Now, let's look at premise 5. It tells us that if John has at least one child, then he does not travel to Paris for his honeymoon and does not have a wedding. Since John has at least one child, according to this premise, he does not have a wedding and does not travel to Paris for his honeymoon. Premise 6 tells us that if John has a wedding that is well-attended, then he has a wedding in July or, if not, then he travels to Paris for their honeymoon. If John has a wedding that is well-attended, it would have to be in July, as we know that all July weddings are well-attended.

The sixth premise states that if John has a wedding that is well-attended, then John has a wedding in July or, if not, then John travels to Paris for their honeymoon. From these premises, we can conclude that John does not have a wedding that is well-attended because if he had a wedding in July, he would be traveling to Paris for his honeymoon, and since he has at least one child, he cannot have a wedding, which contradicts the fourth premise that some weddings in July are well-attended.

Therefore, it is uncertain whether John has neither a wedding that is well-attended nor does he travel to Paris for his honeymoon.\nANSWER:\tUncertain\n", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate the statement \"John has neither a wedding that is well-attended nor does he travel to Paris for his honeymoon.\" First, let's analyze the premises. We know that all people who have a wedding have at least one child, and all people who travel to Paris for their honeymoon have a wedding. This means that if John has a wedding, he must have at least one child. From the premises, we also know that all weddings in July are weddings that people travel to Paris for their honeymoon. Therefore, if John has a wedding in July, he must travel to Paris for his honeymoon. Finally, we know that some weddings in July are well-attended, so John could have a wedding that is well-attended if he has a wedding in July. From this, we can deduce that if John has a child, he might have a wedding, and if he has a wedding, he might have a well-attended wedding, or he might travel to Paris for his honeymoon. However, the last premise states that if John has a wedding that is well-attended, then John has a wedding in July or if not, then John travels to Paris for their honeymoon. This premise creates a conditional relationship between John's well-attended wedding and his traveling to Paris for his honeymoon. Combining all this information, we can infer that if John has a child, he might have a wedding, and if he has a wedding, he might have a well-attended wedding, or he might travel to Paris for his honeymoon. However, we cannot definitively conclude that John has neither a wedding that is well-attended nor does he travel to Paris for his honeymoon based on the given premises. Therefore, the conclusion is uncertain.\nANSWER:\tUncertain\n", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if John has neither a wedding that is well-attended nor does he travel to Paris for his honeymoon. Let's break down the premises first:\n\n1. All people who have a wedding are people who have at least one child.\n2. All people who travel to Paris for their honeymoon are people who have a wedding.\n3. All weddings that occur in July belong to people who travel to Paris for their honeymoon.\n4. Some weddings in July are well-attended.\n5. If John has at least one child, then John does not travel to Paris for his honeymoon and does not have a wedding.\n6. If John has a wedding that is well-attended, then John has a wedding in July or, if not, then John travels to Paris for their honeymoon.\n\nFrom Premise 1, we know that John has at least one child if he has a wedding. From Premise 5, if John has at least one child, then he does not travel to Paris for his honeymoon and does not have a wedding. Therefore, if John has a wedding, he cannot have a wedding that is well-attended, because Premise 4 tells us some weddings in July are well-attended, and if John has a wedding, he cannot travel to Paris (Premise 5).\n\nIf John does not have a wedding, then according to Premise 6, if he does not have a wedding that is well-attended, then he travels to Paris for their honeymoon.\n\nSo, if John has a wedding, then he does not have a wedding that is well-attended, and does not travel to Paris. If John does not have a wedding, then he travels to Paris for their honeymoon (since he does not have a wedding that is well-attended).\n\nIn conclusion, John can either have a wedding (and thus not have a wedding that is well-attended, nor travel to Paris) or he does not have a wedding (and thus travels to Paris for their honeymoon, and does not have a wedding that is well-attended).\n\nThis implies that the conclusion \"John has neither a wedding that is well-attended nor does he travel to Paris for his honeymoon\" cannot be true in all cases. The statement is thus uncertain.\nANSWER:\tUncertain\n", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if John has neither a wedding that is well-attended nor does he travel to Paris for his honeymoon. We know that John has at least one child, so he has a wedding. We also know that John does not travel to Paris for his honeymoon and does not have a wedding. Since John has a wedding, he cannot have a wedding that is well-attended, and since he does not travel to Paris for his honeymoon, he cannot have a wedding in July, nor does he have a wedding that is well-attended. Therefore, John has neither a wedding that is well-attended nor does he travel to Paris for his honeymoon, so the statement is true.\nANSWER: True\n", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if John has neither a wedding that is well-attended nor does he travel to Paris for his honeymoon. From the third premise, we know that all weddings that occur in July belong to people who travel to Paris for their honeymoon. This means that if John has a wedding in July, then he travels to Paris for his honeymoon. The second premise tells us that all people who travel to Paris for their honeymoon are people who have a wedding. This means that if John travels to Paris for his honeymoon, then he has a wedding. Since all weddings in July are well-attended, it means that if John has a wedding, then it is well-attended. Combining this information, we know that if John has a wedding, it is well-attended and he travels to Paris for his honeymoon. So we can conclude that if John has a wedding, then he does not have a wedding that is not well-attended and he does not travel to Paris for his honeymoon. Therefore, the statement is true, so the answer is True.\nANSWER: True\n", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if John has neither a wedding that is well-attended nor does he travel to Paris for his honeymoon. Let's analyze the premises step by step:\n\n1. All people who have a wedding are people who have at least one child. This means that having a wedding is a sufficient condition for having at least one child, but it doesn't guarantee it. We need to check if John has a child to determine if he has a wedding.\n\n2. All people who travel to Paris for their honeymoon are people who have a wedding. This means that traveling to Paris for a honeymoon is a sufficient condition for having a wedding, but it doesn't guarantee it. We need to check if John travels to Paris for a honeymoon to determine if he has a wedding.\n\n3. All weddings that occur in July belong to people who travel to Paris for their honeymoon. This means that weddings in July are a subset of people who travel to Paris for their honeymoon. Therefore, if John has a wedding in July, he travels to Paris for his honeymoon.\n\n4. Some weddings in July are well-attended. This means that there are weddings in July that are attended by a significant number of people.\n\n5. If John has at least one child, then John does not travel to Paris for his honeymoon and does not have a wedding. This premise directly contradicts premise 2, which states that all people who travel to Paris for their honeymoon are people who have a wedding.\n\n6. If John has a wedding that is well-attended, then John has a wedding in July or, if not, then John travels to Paris for their honeymoon. This premise implies that a well-attended wedding in July means John travels to Paris for his honeymoon, but it doesn't say anything about weddings that are not well-attended in July or weddings in other months.\n\nGiven the contradiction in premise 5 and premise 2, we cannot logically conclude that John has neither a wedding that is well-attended nor does he travel to Paris for his honeymoon. In fact, if John has a child, he cannot have a wedding and cannot travel to Paris for his honeymoon, which contradicts the information given in premise 4 (some weddings in July are well-attended).\n\nTherefore, the statement is false.\nANSWER:\tFalse\n"], "answers": ["Uncertain", "True", "Uncertain", "False", "Uncertain", "Uncertain", "Uncertain", "True", "True", "False"], "reference": "True", "time_total": 29.152806997299194, "time_llm": 29.151612758636475, "prompt_length": 8968}

Therefore, the conclusion is false.\nANSWER:\tFalse\n", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate whether the statement \"Platypus are reptiles\" is true, false, or uncertain given the premises. First, we know from the premises that platypus are mammals. Second, we know that some mammals have teeth, but platypus do not have teeth. Third, we know that humans have teeth. Now, we can infer that platypus do not share the common trait of having teeth with humans, but they are still mammals. Since the premises provide no information about reptiles, and platypus are explicitly stated to be mammals, the conclusion that platypus are reptiles is false.\nANSWER:\tFalse\n", "Let's think step by step. We know from the premises that Platypus are mammals, and that some mammals have teeth. We also know that Platypus have no teeth. This contradicts the statement that some mammals have teeth. However, the conclusion that Platypus are reptiles is not related to the premises about teeth and mammals. The fact that Platypus are mammals with no teeth contradicts the conclusion that they are reptiles. Since being a reptile is incompatible with being a mammal, the conclusion that Platypus are reptiles must be false. The premises about teeth do not support the conclusion about Platypus being reptiles, so the conclusion does not follow from the premises. Therefore, the answer is FALSE.\nANSWER:\tFalse\n", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if the conclusion \"Platypus are reptiles\" follows from the premises. The premises state that platypus are mammals, and mammals have teeth, but platypus have no teeth. Additionally, humans are mammals and have teeth. The conclusion contradicts the premises because it incorrectly states that platypus are reptiles, which is not supported by any of the given premises. Therefore, the conclusion does not follow from the premises, and the answer is false.\nANSWER:\tFalse\n", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if the conclusion \"Platypus are reptiles\" is true given the premises. The premises state that some mammals have teeth, platypus have no teeth, platypus are mammals, and humans have teeth. From these premises, we can infer that platypus are mammals because they have no teeth and humans, who are also mammals, have teeth. However, none of the premises state anything about platypus being reptiles or not. Reptiles are a separate class of animals that do not have mammalian characteristics such as hair or mammary glands. Since the premises do not provide any information about platypus being reptiles, we cannot conclude that platypus are reptiles. Therefore, the statement is false.\nANSWER:\tFalse\n", "The premise [BG] asserts that some mammals have teeth. Since platypus are mammals, they must fall under the category of mammals that have teeth according to the premise. However, the premise also states that platypus have no teeth, which contradicts the idea that all mammals have teeth. This contradiction indicates that there is an error in the premises or the conclusion being drawn. Since the conclusion claims that platypus are reptiles, which is factually incorrect as platypus are indeed mammals, the conclusion is false. Therefore, the answer is False, not Uncertain as previously stated. Let's correct the reasoning process.\n\nLet's think step by step. We want to evaluate if the conclusion \"Platypus are reptiles\" follows from the premises. The premise [BG] states that some mammals have teeth, and humans have teeth, which are mammals. This implies that not all mammals have teeth, but humans do. The premise also states that platypus have no teeth, which means platypus do not fall under the category of mammals that have teeth. However, the fact that platypus do not have teeth does not imply that they are reptiles; it only tells us about the characteristics of platypus teeth. Platypus are indeed mammals, and the fact that they do not have teeth does not change their classification as mammals. Therefore, the conclusion that platypus are reptiles is false because it contradicts the established fact that platypus are mammals. So the answer is False.\nANSWER:\tFalse\n", "Let's think step by step. We are given the following premises:\n\n1. Some mammals have teeth.\n2. Platypus have no teeth.\n3. Platypus are mammals.\n4. Humans have teeth.\n\nWe are asked to evaluate the conclusion: \"Platypus are reptiles.\"\n\nTo evaluate this, let's consider the given information:\n\n- Premise 3 states that Platypus are mammals.\n- Premise 2 states that Platypus have no teeth.\n\nMammals are characterized by having teeth (from Premise 1), and humans (who are also mammals) have teeth (from Premise 4). Therefore, having no teeth (Premise 2) contradicts the characteristic of being a mammal (Premise 3).\n\nSince Platypus are described as mammals in Premise 3 and also have no teeth, this contradiction indicates that the premise is likely incorrect. However, even if we assume for the sake of argument that there was a typographical error in Premise 3 and Platypus are actually reptiles, Premise 3 would then be false.\n\nGiven that the premises contain contradictory information, we cannot logically derive the conclusion \"Platypus are reptiles\" from the given premises.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is not necessarily true based on the provided premises, and we should conclude that the answer is:\n\nANSWER: Uncertain\n\n(Note: The answer provided in the original text was incorrect because it was based on the assumption that the premises were consistent, which they are not.

Platypus have no teeth.\n3. Platypus are mammals.\n4. Humans have teeth.\n\nFrom these premises, we can deduce that since Platypus are mammals and some mammals have teeth, but Platypus have no teeth, this is inconsistent with the statement that all mammals have teeth (premise 1).

We want to evaluate if it is not true that Rose is a student and Jerry is a human. First, let's analyze what we know about Jerry. We know that Jerry neither teaches nor is a manager. Since all students are humans, and all humans study, we know that Jerry is a human. Next, let's analyze what we know about Rose. We know that Rose is either young or a student. However, we don't know whether Rose is young or a student, so we can't know whether Rose is a student. However, since all students are humans, and all humans study, we know that Jerry is a human. Next, let's analyze the conclusion. We know that Rose is either young or a student. If Rose is a student, then she is a human, and the statement is false. If Rose is young, then she is not a student, and the statement is also false. Therefore, the statement is false, so the answer is false.\nANSWER:\tFalse\n", "Let's think step by step. We need to evaluate the conclusion that \"It is not true that Rose is a student and Jerry is a human.\" First, let's analyze the premises to gather information about Jerry and Rose.\n\n1. \"All students are humans.\" This implies that if someone is a student, then they must be a human.\n2. \"If someone studies, then they are a student.\" This means that studying implies being a student.\n3. \"A person either studies or teaches.\" This means every person is either a student or a teacher.\n4. \"No young person teaches.\" This implies that if someone is young, then they cannot be a teacher.\n5. \"Jerry neither teaches nor is a manager.\" This means Jerry is neither a teacher nor a manager, but it doesn't tell us whether he is a student or not.\n6. \"Rose is young or a student.\" This means Rose is either young or a student, but it doesn't tell us her exact status.\n\nNow, let's analyze the conclusion:\n\"The conclusion states: 'It is not true that Rose is a student and Jerry is a human.'\"\n\nFrom the premises, we know the following:\n- All students are humans. If Rose is a student, she is a human.\n- Jerry is a human (since all students are humans and Jerry could be a student).\n- There are no additional details to definitively state whether Rose is a student or not.\n\nSince the only way the conclusion \"It is not true that Rose is a student and Jerry is a human\" would be correct is if Rose is not a student, we cannot definitively determine this from the given premises. Therefore, we cannot confirm the conclusion as true or false.\n\nSo the answer is:\nANSWER:\tUncertain\n", "Let's think step by step. We need to evaluate if the conclusion \"It is not true that Rose is a student and Jerry is a human\" follows from the premises given.\n\n1. All students are humans.\n2. If someone studies, then they are a student.\n3. A person either studies or teaches.\n4. No young person teaches.\n5. Jerry neither teaches nor is a manager.\n6. Rose is young or a student.\n\nFrom these premises, let's break down the information about Rose and Jerry:\n\n- From Premise 6, Rose is either young or a student.\n- From Premise 4, if Rose is young, she cannot teach. Since teaching is not mentioned in relation to Rose directly, this doesn't affect our conclusion.\n- If Rose is a student, then she is also a human (Premise 1).\n\n- From Premise 5, Jerry neither teaches nor is a manager.\n- From Premise 3, since Jerry neither teaches nor is a manager, he must be a student (because a person either studies or teaches).\n- If Jerry is a student, then he is also a human (Premise 1).\n\nNow, considering the conclusion:\n- The conclusion states: \"It is not true that Rose is a student and Jerry is a human.\"\n\nTo determine the truth of this conclusion, we need to evaluate whether both Rose being a student and Jerry being a human are simultaneously true or not:\n- If Rose is a student, then she is a human.\n- If Jerry is a student, then he is a human.\n\nGiven the premises, both Rose and Jerry being students would imply they are humans. Thus, the statement \"Rose is a student and Jerry is a human\" could indeed be true based on the premises. Therefore, the conclusion \"It is not true that Rose is a student and Jerry is a human\" is incorrect.\n\nSo, the conclusion is:\nANSWER:\tFalse\n", "Let's think step by step.

Rose is young or a student.\n\nWe want to determine if the conclusion \"It is not true that Rose is a student and Jerry is a human\" is true.\n\nFrom Premise 1, we know that all students are humans. Therefore, if Rose is a student, she must be a human. \n\nFrom Premise 6, we know that Rose is either young or a student. This means that Rose could be a student, in which case she is a human.\n\nFrom Premise 5, we know that Jerry is neither a teacher nor a manager. This tells us that Jerry is not teaching, but it does not tell us anything about whether Jerry is a human or not.\n\nTherefore, from the given premises, we cannot conclude that Rose is a student and Jerry is a human. However, we cannot conclude either that it is not true that Rose is a student and Jerry is a human either.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the given premises, we cannot definitively evaluate the truth of the statement \"It is not true that Rose is a student and Jerry is a human\".

From premise 5, we know that Rose is young or a student. If we assume that Rose is young, then she cannot teach, but that doesn't contradict any of the premises, so we can't conclude that she is a student.

From premise 4, we know that Jerry is not a teacher. Since Jerry is not a teacher, he is not excluded from being a student, so it is possible for Jerry to be a student. Since Jerry is a human because he could be a student, and Rose is either young or a student, but since Rose is young, she cannot be a student, it is not true that Rose is a student and Jerry is a human.\nANSWER: True\n", "Let's think step by step.

From premise 3, we know that no young person teaches, and since Rose is either young or a student, it doesn't tell us anything about Rose being a student. Therefore, it is possible that Rose is a student, so we cannot be certain whether Rose is a student. We know that Jerry is a human, so the statement is true. Therefore, the statement is true.\nANSWER:\tTrue\n", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate the statement \"it is not true that Rose is a student and Jerry is a human.\" This statement can be translated to \"either Rose is not a student or Jerry is not a human\" or \"it is not the case that both Rose is a student and Jerry is a human.\" Let's examine the premises. From premise 1, we know that all students are humans, so Jerry, being a human, must be a student. From premise 3, we know that no young person teaches. Since Jerry neither teaches nor is a manager, and all students are humans, Jerry must be a student. From premise 4, we know that Rose is either young or a student. Since we know that Jerry is a student, this premise does not provide information about whether Rose is a student. From premise 5, we know that Rose is either young or a student. This means that Rose could be a student, but it doesn't confirm that she is a student. Therefore, it is uncertain whether Rose is a student, and we cannot confirm the statement \"it is not true that Rose is a student and Jerry is a human\" as either true or false. So, the conclusion is uncertain.\nANSWER:\tUncertain\n", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if it is not true that Rose is a student and Jerry is a human. First, let's consider the premise that Rose is either young or a student. If Rose is young, then according to the premise, she cannot be a student. On the other hand, if Rose is a student, then she is a human (since all students are humans). Since the conclusion is asserting that it is not true that Rose is a student and Jerry is a human, we can infer that Rose cannot be a student and Jerry cannot be a human. Now, let's consider the premise that Jerry neither teaches nor is a manager. Since Jerry neither teaches nor is a manager, we cannot conclude anything about whether Jerry is a human or not from this premise. However, since the conclusion is about Jerry being a human, we know that Jerry must be a human (since the conclusion is asserting that Jerry is not a human).

We know that New Vessel Press specializes in translating foreign literature into English, and we know that Neapolitan Chronicles and Palace of Flies, which were published by New Vessel Press, were translated from Italian and French, respectively. Harry Potter is not mentioned in the premises, and there is no information to suggest that New Vessel Press published a book in English that was originally written in a foreign language other than Italian or French.

From premise 4, we know that all people who work regularly and often at home visit the office supply store regularly.\n\n6. From premise 5, we know that if people spend their free time tidying and organizing the spaces in their home, then they do not go to bed late and wake up every day after noon.\n\n7. From premise 6, we also know that Remy either both goes to bed late and wakes up every day after noon and spends their free time tidying and organizing the spaces in their home, or they do not go to bed late and wake up every day after noon nor spend their free time tidying and organizing the spaces in their home.\n\n8. Combining premises 3 and 7, we can deduce that Remy does not go to bed late and wake up every day after noon nor spend their free time tidying and organizing the spaces in their home.\n\n9. From premise 8, we can deduce that Remy does not have a fully stocked and impressive home office, because people who have a fully stocked and impressive home office work regularly and often at home and spend their free time tidying and organizing the spaces in their home.\n\n10. From premise 9, we can deduce that Remy does not visit the office supply store regularly, because people who visit the office supply store regularly work regularly and often at home.\n\n11. Since Remy neither has a fully stocked and impressive home office nor visits the office supply store regularly, we can conclude that Remy does not have a fully stocked and impressive home office and also does not visit the office supply store regularly.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: FALSE.\n", "Let's think step by step.\n\n1. From the first premise, we know that if Remy owns a large desktop monitor at their home, then they work regularly and often at home.\n\n2. From the second premise, we know that all people who have a fully stocked and impressive home office are people who own a large desktop monitor at their home.\n\n3. From the third premise, we know that all people who work regularly and often at home spend their free time tidying and organizing the spaces in their homes.\n\n4. From the fourth premise, we know that all people who work regularly and often at home visit the office supply store regularly.\n\n5. From the fifth premise, we know that if Remy spends their free time tidying and organizing the spaces in their home, then they do not go to bed late and wake up every day after noon.\n\n6.

Combining the information from steps 2 and 3, we know that Remy has a fully stocked and impressive home office, which means they own a large desktop monitor at their home and work regularly and often at home.\n\n8. Combining the information from steps 7 and 4, we know that Remy works regularly and often at home, which means they visit the office supply store regularly.\n\n9. Combining the information from steps 7 and 8, we know that Remy has a fully stocked and impressive home office, works regularly and often at home, visits the office supply store regularly, and spends their free time tidying and organizing the spaces in their home.\n\n10. Combining the information from steps 9 and 5, we know that Remy does not go to bed late and wake up every day after noon, as they spend their free time tidying and organizing the spaces in their home.\n\n11. Combining the information from steps 10 and 6, we know that Remy does not go to bed late and wake up every day after noon, nor spend their free time tidying and organizing the spaces in their home.\n\n12. Therefore, Remy has a fully stocked and impressive home office, works regularly and often at home, visits the office supply store regularly, but does not go to bed late and wake up every day after noon, nor spend their free time tidying and organizing the spaces in their home.\n\nThe statement \"Remy has a fully stocked and impressive home office and also visits the office supply store regularly\" is TRUE based on the premises given.\n\nANSWER: True\n", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if Remy has a fully stocked and impressive home office and also visits the office supply store regularly. The premises state that Remy either both goes to bed late and wakes up every day after noon and spends their free time tidying and organizing the spaces in their home, or they do not go to bed late and wake up every day after noon nor spend their free time tidying and organizing the spaces in their home. From the second part of the premise, we know that Remy does not spend their free time tidying and organizing the spaces in their home, which means Remy does not own a large desktop monitor at their home. Since owning a large desktop monitor at home is a necessary condition for having a fully stocked and impressive home office, we know that Remy does not have a fully stocked and impressive home office. We also know that Remy visits the office supply store regularly if they work regularly and often at home. Since Remy does not own a large desktop monitor at home, we know that Remy does not work regularly and often at home. Therefore, we know that Remy does not visit the office supply store regularly. Therefore, the conclusion that Remy has a fully stocked and impressive home office and also visits the office supply store regularly is false.\nANSWER:\tFalse\n", "Let's think step by step. We need to evaluate if Remy has a fully stocked and impressive home office and also visits the office supply store regularly, given the premises.\n\n1. Premise 1: If people own a large desktop monitor at their home, then they work regularly and often at home.\n2. Premise 2: All people who have a fully stocked and impressive home office are people who own a large desktop monitor at their home.\n3. Premise 3: All people who work regularly and often at home spend their free time tidying and organizing the spaces in their homes.\n4. Premise 4: All people who work regularly and often at home visit the office supply store regularly.\n5. Premise 5: If people spend their free time tidying and organizing the spaces in their home, then they do not go to bed late and wake up every day after noon.\n6. Premise 6: Remy either both goes to bed late and wakes up every day after noon and spends their free time tidying and organizing the spaces in their home, or they do not go to bed late and wake up every day after noon nor spend their free time tidying and organizing the spaces in their home.\n\nFirst, let's consider the implications of Premise 6 for Remy's habits. Remy either:\n- Goes to bed late and wakes up every day after noon, and spends their free time tidying and organizing the spaces in their home, or\n- Does not go to bed late and wakes up every day after noon, and does not spend their free time tidying and organizing the spaces in their home.\n\nNext, let's analyze the implications for each scenario.\n\n**Scenario 1: Remy goes to bed late and wakes up every day after noon, and spends their free time tidying and organizing the spaces in their home.**\n- From Premise 5, if Remy spends their free time tidying and organizing the spaces in their home, they do not go to bed late and wake up every day after noon. This creates a contradiction because Premise 5 requires that if someone spends their free time tidying and organizing, they do not go to bed late and wake up every day after noon.\n- Therefore, Scenario 1 cannot be true.\n\n**Scenario 2: Remy does not go to bed late and wakes up every day after noon, and does not spend their free time tidying and organizing the spaces in their home.**\n- From Premise 5, if Remy does not go to bed late and wake up every day after noon, they can either spend their free time tidying and organizing the spaces in their home, or they can do neither.\n- We are given that Remy does not spend their free time tidying and organizing the spaces in their home.\n- Therefore, Remy does not go to bed late and wake up every day after noon (satisfying Premise 5).\n- From Premise 3, if Remy works regularly and often at home, they will spend their free time tidying and organizing the spaces in their home.\n- Since Remy does not spend their free time tidying and organizing the spaces in their home, Remy cannot work regularly and often at home.\n\nGiven these contradictions, we cannot conclude that Remy has a fully stocked and impressive home office because it implies Remy works regularly and often at home, which we have established they do not.\n\nTherefore, the statement that Remy has a fully stocked and impressive home office and also visits the office supply store regularly is **uncertain**.\n\nANSWER:\tUncertain\n", "Let's break down the premises and analyze the conclusion step by step.\n\nPremise 1: If people own a large desktop monitor at their home, then they work regularly and often at home.\n\nPremise 2: All people who have a fully stocked and impressive home office are people who own a large desktop monitor at their home.\n\nPremise 3: All people who work regularly and often at home spend their free time tidying and organizing the spaces in their homes.\n\nPremise 4: All people who work regularly and often at home visit the office supply store regularly.\n\nPremise 5: If people spend their free time tidying and organizing the spaces in their home, then they do not go to bed late and wake up every day after noon.\n\nPremise 6: Remy either both goes to bed late and wakes up every day after noon and spends their free time tidying and organizing the spaces in their home, or they do not go to bed late and wake up every day after noon nor spend their free time tidying and organizing the spaces in their home.\n\nWe need to determine if Remy has a fully stocked and impressive home office and also visits the office supply store regularly.\n\nFrom Premise 6, we know that Remy does not go to bed late and wake up every day after noon nor spend their free time tidying and organizing the spaces in their home. This means that Remy cannot have a fully stocked and impressive home office (Premise 2) or visit the office supply store regularly (Premise 4).\n\nTherefore, the conclusion that Remy has a fully stocked and impressive home office and also visits the office supply store regularly cannot be true given the premises provided.\n\nANSWER: False\n", "Let's think step by step. The conclusion states two facts about Remy: (1) Remy has a fully stocked and impressive home office, and (2) Remy visits the office supply store regularly. From the premises, we can deduce that Remy works regularly and often at home, which implies owning a large desktop monitor at their home. This means that Remy would have a fully stocked and impressive home office, satisfying the first part of the conclusion.\n\nFor the second part of the conclusion, since Remy works regularly and often at home, they spend their free time tidying and organizing the spaces in their homes. This also implies that Remy visits the office supply store regularly, as they would need to replenish supplies for their home office. Therefore, both parts of the conclusion are true.\n\nSo, the conclusion is TRUE.\nANSWER:\tTrue\n", "Let's think step by step.

We also know that all people who work regularly and often at home spend their free time tidying and organizing the spaces in their homes (Premise 3). We know that all people who work regularly and often at home visit the office supply store regularly (Premise 4). Therefore, if Remy has a fully stocked and impressive home office, then Remy works regularly and often at home, spends their free time tidying and organizing the spaces in their home, and visits the office supply store regularly. The only thing left to check is whether Remy either both goes to bed late and wakes up every day after noon, or they do not go to bed late and wake up every day after noon, nor spend their free time tidying and organizing the spaces in their home (Premise 5). Premise 5 says that if people spend their free time tidying and organizing the spaces in their home, then they do not go to bed late and wake up every day after noon. So if Remy has a fully stocked and impressive home office, then Remy does not go to bed late and wake up every day after noon. This satisfies the condition in Premise 5.

Thus, if Remy goes to bed late and wakes up every day after noon, they would still work regularly and often at home, and hence, they must spend their free time tidying and organizing their home.\n\nSince Remy goes to bed late and wakes up every day after noon, they cannot avoid tidying and organizing their home, which conflicts with the conclusion that Remy neither spends their free time tidying and organizing the spaces in their home nor has a fully stocked and impressive home office.\n\nTherefore, given the premises, the conclusion is false.\n\nANSWER:\tFalse\n", "Let's think step by step.\n\nWe want to evaluate whether the conclusion follows from the premises.\n\nThe premises can be broken down as follows:\n\n1. If people own a large desktop monitor at their home, then they work regularly and often at home.\n2. All people who have a fully stocked and impressive home office are people who own a large desktop monitor at their home.\n3. All people who work regularly and often at home spend their free time tidying and organizing the spaces in their homes.\n4. All people who work regularly and often at home visit the office supply store regularly.\n5. If people spend their free time tidying and organizing the spaces in their home, then they do not go to bed late and wake up every day after noon.\n6. Remy either both goes to bed late and wakes up every day after noon and spends their free time tidying and organizing the spaces in their home, or they do not go to bed late and wake up every day after noon nor spend their free time tidying and organizing the spaces in their home.\n\nThe conclusion can be broken down as follows:\n\nIf Remy either goes to bed late and wakes up every day after noon or visits the office supply store regularly, then Remy neither spends their free time tidying and organizing the spaces in their home nor has a fully stocked and impressive home office.\n\nTo determine if the conclusion follows, we need to see if the given conditions in the conclusion can be derived from the premises.\n\nPremise 4 states that all people who work regularly and often at home visit the office supply store regularly. Premise 3 states that all people who work regularly and often at home spend their free time tidying and organizing the spaces in their home.\n\nFrom Premise 5, we know that if people spend their free time tidying and organizing the spaces in their home, then they do not go to bed late and wake up every day after noon.\n\nWe also know from Premise 2 that all people who have a fully stocked and impressive home office are people who own a large desktop monitor at their home. From Premise 1, we know that if people own a large desktop monitor at their home, then they work regularly and often at home.\n\nSo, if Remy visits the office supply store regularly (Premise 4), then they must work regularly and often at home (Premise 1). And if they work regularly and often at home (Premise 1), then they spend their free time tidying and organizing the spaces in their home (Premise 3). And if they spend their free time tidying and organizing the spaces in their home (Premise 3), then they do not go to bed late and wake up every day after noon (Premise 5). And if they do not go to bed late and wake up every day after noon (Premise 5), then they do not have a fully stocked and impressive home office (Premise 2).\n\nSo, if Remy visits the office supply store regularly, then they neither spend their free time tidying and organizing the spaces in their home nor have a fully stocked and impressive home office.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion follows from the premises.\n\nANSWER:\tTrue\n", "Let P: Remy both goes to bed late and wakes up every day after noon.\nQ: Remy visits the office supply store regularly.\nR: Remy spends their free time tidying and organizing the spaces in their home.\nS: Remy has a fully stocked and impressive home office.\nLet P \u2227 Q: Remy both goes to bed late and wakes up every day after noon and visits the office supply store regularly.\nLet P \u2227 \u00acR: Remy both goes to bed late and wakes up every day after noon and does not spend their free time tidying and organizing the spaces in their home.\nLet \u00acP \u2227 \u00acQ: Remy neither goes to bed late nor wakes up every day after noon, nor visits the office supply store regularly.\nLet P \u2227 S: Remy both goes to bed late, wakes up every day after noon, and has a fully stocked and impressive home office.\nLet P \u2227 \u00acS: Remy both goes to bed late, wakes up every day after noon, and does not have a fully stocked and impressive home office.\nPremise 1: If P \u2227 Q, then R \u2227 P.\nPremise 2: If R, then \u00acS.\nPremise 3: P \u2227 Q \u2228 P \u2227 \u00acR \u2228 \u00acP \u2227 \u00acQ.\nPremise 4: P \u2227 S \u2228 \u00acP \u2227 \u00acS.\nCONCLUSION: If P \u2227 Q \u2228 P \u2227 \u00acQ, then R \u2227 \u00acS \u2228 \u00acR \u2227 \u00acS.\nPremise 1 says P \u2227 Q implies R \u2227 P.

This is because if P \u2227 Q, then R \u2227 P, and if R, then \u00acS, so P \u2227 Q implies R \u2227 \u00acS, which is D. Therefore, A \u2228 D.\nSecond, notice that if C, then E. This is because if \u00acP \u2227 \u00acQ, then \u00acR \u2227 \u00acS, so \u00acP \u2227 \u00acQ implies \u00acR \u2227 \u00acS, which is E. Therefore, C \u2228 E.\nFinally, notice that if B, then E. This is because if P \u2227 \u00acR, then \u00acR \u2227 \u00acS, so P \u2227 \u00acR implies \u00acR \u2227 \u00acS, which is E. Therefore, B \u2228 E.\nNow, since we know A \u2228 D, B \u2228 E, and C \u2228 E, we can conclude D \u2228 E, since D or E must be true in one of the disjunctions. Therefore, if P \u2227 Q or P \u2227 \u00acQ, then R \u2227 \u00acS or \u00acR \u2227 \u00acS. The statement is true.\nANSWER: True\n", "Let's think step by step.

This conclusion is a contrapositive of Premise 3. The contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement.

To evaluate the conclusion \"If George will not compose, George cannot compose,\" we can follow the contrapositive reasoning. The contrapositive of a statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\" Applying this to our premises:\n\n1. If George likes music, he wants to compose (P1).\n2. If George has access to a program, he can compose (P2).\n3. If George can compose and wants to compose, he will compose (P3).\n\nThe contrapositive of P3 is: If George will not compose, George does not want to compose (not Q3).\n\nNow let's analyze the contrapositive of the given premises:\n\n- The contrapositive of P1 is: If George does not want to compose, George does not like music (not Q1).\n- The contrapositive of P2 is: If George cannot compose, George does not have access to a program (not Q2).\n\nCombining these contrapositive statements, we can infer that if George will not compose (not Q3), then George does not want to compose (not Q1) and/or George does not have access to a program (not Q2).\n\nHowever, the given conclusion \"If George will not compose, George cannot compose\" (not Q3) is already a given fact from P3. The contrapositive of P3 states that if George will not compose, then he does not want to compose, but it does not directly imply that George cannot compose.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is not directly supported by the given premises, and the answer is:\nANSWER:\tUncertain\n", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if if George will not compose, George cannot compose. Let's first think about the premises. We have three premises:\n\n1. If George likes music, he wants to compose.\n2. If George has access to a program, he can compose.\n3. If George can compose and wants to compose, he will compose.\n\nWe need to evaluate if \"if George will not compose, George cannot compose\" is true given these premises. Let's consider the contrapositive of the third premise: \"If George will not compose, he either does not want to compose or he cannot compose.\" This means that if George will not compose, it's possible that he either does not want to compose or he cannot compose.\n\nFrom this, we can see that if George will not compose, he may not be able to compose due to lack of desire or lack of ability (implied by not having access to a program). However, the premises do not provide enough information to conclude definitively that George cannot compose just because he will not compose. He might be unable to compose due to other reasons, such as not having access to a program or not wanting to compose despite having the ability.\n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively say that \"if George will not compose, George cannot compose\" is true given the premises.

From the first premise, we know that if George likes music, he wants to compose. This means that George can compose and wants to compose.

If George has access to a program, he can compose. And if George can compose and wants to compose, he will compose. The conclusion we are trying to evaluate is: \"If George will not compose, George cannot compose.\" We can approach this by using the contrapositive of the last statement provided: \"If George will not compose, he does not want to compose or he cannot compose.\" Since the first premise establishes that liking music leads to wanting to compose, and the second premise establishes that having access to a program leads to being able to compose, it can be inferred that George's inability to compose implies either that he does not want to compose or that he does not have access to a program. The original statement assumes that George will not compose if and only if he cannot compose, which is a stronger claim than the contrapositive of the provided statement. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that George will not compose solely because he cannot compose.

We know that everything on the Bachelor portrays the lives of real people, so on these Mondays, roses given out on the Bachelor are reality TV shows. We know that all shows portraying the lives of real people are reality TV shows, so these roses given out on reality TV shows are reality TV shows.

However, from premise 5, we know that Breaking Bad is not a reality TV show.

From the premises, we know that on some Mondays at 8 pm, roses are given out on TV, and every rose given out on TV is on the Bachelor.

However, the conclusion that Breaking Bad is on Monday at 8 pm is stronger than the premise that it is just on some Mondays at 8 pm.

Breaking Bad is not a reality TV show.\n\nFrom these premises, we can infer the following:\n\n- Premise 1 tells us that on some Mondays at 8 pm, roses (and thus, by Premise 2, the Bachelor) are shown on TV.\n- Premise 3 tells us that the Bachelor shows the lives of real people, which means it is a reality TV show because of Premise 4.\n- Premise 5 tells us that Breaking Bad is not a reality TV show.\n\nGiven this information, we can deduce that Breaking Bad cannot be shown on the Bachelor, as the Bachelor is a reality TV show. Therefore, Breaking Bad cannot be aired on TV at 8 pm on Mondays, since the roses (and the Bachelor) are only given out on TV at that time.\n\nThe conclusion \"Breaking Bad is on Monday at 8 pm\" does not logically follow from the premises provided.

{"idx": 165, "prompt": "The following is a first-order logic (FOL) problem.\nThe problem is to determine whether the conclusion follows from the premises.\nThe premises are given in the form of a set of first-order logic sentences.\nThe conclusion is given in the form of a single first-order logic sentence.\nThe task is to evaluate the conclusion as ANSWER: True, ANSWER: False, or ANSWER: Uncertain given the premises.

We want to evaluate if a worksheet is not dispensable. From premise 6, we know that a worksheet is either paper or is environment-friendly. If it is paper, then from premise 3, a worksheet is woodware, and from premise 2, a worksheet is dispensable. If it is environment-friendly, we know it is good from premise 5, but we know nothing about whether it is dispensable. Therefore, we don't know if a worksheet is dispensible or not, so the statement is uncertain.\nANSWER:\tUncertain\n</EVALUATE>\n\n---\n<PREMISES>\nA La Liga soccer team ranks higher than another if it receives more points.\nIf two La Liga soccer teams recieve the same points, the team which recieves more points from the games between the two teams ranks higher.\nReal Madrid and Barcelona are both La Liga soccer teams.\nIn La Liga 2021-2022, Real Madrid recieves 86 points and Barcelon recieves 73 points.\nIn La Liga 2021-2022, Real Madrid and Barcelona both recieve 3 points from the games between them.\n</PREMISES>\n<CONCLUSION>\nIn La Liga 2021-2022, Real Madrid ranks higher than Barcelona.\n</CONCLUSION>\n<EVALUATE>\n\nLet's think step by step. We want to evaluate if in La Liga 2021-2022, Real Madrid ranks higher than Barcelona. From premise 1, we know that a La Liga soccer team ranks higher than another if it receives more points. From premise 4, we know that in La Liga 2021-2022, Real Madrid received more points than Barcelona. Therefore, in La Liga 2021-2022, Real Madrid received more points than Barcelona, so Real Madrid ranks higher than Barcelona, so the statement is true.\nANSWER:\tTrue\n</EVALUATE>\n\n---\n<PREMISES>\nAll athletes are good at sports.\nAll Olympic gold medal winners are good athletes.\nNo scientists are good at sports.\nAll Nobel laureates are scientists.\nAmy is good at sports or Amy is an Olympic gold medal winner.\nIf Amy is not a Nobel laureate, then Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner.\n</PREMISES>\n<CONCLUSION>\nIf Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner, then Amy is a Nobel laureate.\n</CONCLUSION>\n<EVALUATE>\n\nLet's think step by step. We want to evaluate the statement \"if Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner, then Amy is a Nobel laureate\". Let's assume that Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner. This doesn't tell us anything about whether Amy is a Nobel laureate, so the statement isn't true, meaning it is either False or Uncertain. To distinguish between the two, notice that we could have a scenario where Amy is neither an Olympic gold medal winner nor a Nobel laureate. None of the premises are violated in this case. This means the statement must be false.\nANSWER:\tFalse\n</EVALUATE>\n\n---\n<PREMISES>\nAll people who are respected by others are people who contribute to the country.\nIf a person is respected by others, then he/she contributes to the country.\nAll people available to have a visit without any fees are those respected by others.\nAll Customers who once served in the army are available to have a visit without any fees.\nAll people who once were sentenced for thief stayed in prison for some time.\nAll people who once stayed in prison for some time have a bad record in the local state.\nJames was either once sentenced for thief or stayed in prison for some time.\nJames is either with a bad record in the local state or respected by others.\n</PREMISES>\n<CONCLUSION>\nJames contributes to the country.\n</CONCLUSION>\n<EVALUATE>\n\nLet's think step by step. We want to evaluate if James contributes to the country. Let's think about what we know about James. First, we know that James was either sentenced for thief or stayed in prison. However, this doesn't tell us anything about whether James contributed to the country. Second, we know that James either had a bad record in the local state or that he was respected by others. However, the premises don't tell us anything about the relationship between having a bad record and contributing to the country. Therefore, it is uncertain whether James contributes to the country.\nANSWER:\tUncertain\n</EVALUATE>\n\n---\n<PREMISES>\nNo songs are visual.\nAll folk songs are songs.\nAll videos are visual.\nAll movies are videos.\nAll sci-fi movies are movies.\nInception is a sci-fi movie.\nMac is neither a folk song nor a sci-fi movie.\n</PREMISES>\n<CONCLUSION>\nInception is a folk song.\n</CONCLUSION>\n<EVALUATE>\n\nLet's think step by step. We want to evaluate if Inception is a folk song. We know that Inception is a sci-fi movie. Since all movies are videos and Inception is a movie, it is a video, which means it is visual. On the other hand, we know that all folk songs are songs, and no songs are visual, so no folk songs are visual. Therefore, since Inception is visual but no folk songs are visual, we know that Inception cannot be a folk song, so the statement is false.\nANSWER:\tFalse\n</EVALUATE>\n\n---\n<PREMISES>\nEvery chef can cook.\nSome people who aren\u2019t chefs can cook.\nPeople who cook can make scrambled eggs and pasta.\nIf someone can make cookies and muffins, they are a baker.\nBakers who can also make scrambled eggs can make a good breakfast.\nLuke can make cookies, scrambled eggs, and muffins, but not pasta.\n</PREMISES>\n<CONCLUSION>\nLuke can make a good breakfast.\n</CONCLUSION>\n<EVALUATE>\n\nLet's think step by step. We want to evaluate if Luke can make a good breakfast. From the last premise, we know that Luke can make cookies, scrambled eggs, and muffins. Since Luke can make cookies and muffins, they are a baker. Now, combining the information we have, since Luke is a baker and can make scrambled eggs, this means that they can make a good breakfast. Therefore, Luke can make a good breakfast, so the statement is true.\nANSWER:\tTrue\n</EVALUATE>\n\n---\n<PREMISES>\nETS develops various standardized tests primarily in the United States for K-12 and higher education.\nETS administers international tests including the TOEFL, TOEIC, GRE and subject tests in more than 180 countries.\nMany of the assessments ETS develops are associated with entry to the US tertiary and quaternary education institutions.\nETS also develops K-12 statewide assessments used for accountability testing in many states.\n</PREMISES>\n<CONCLUSION>\nETS develops assessments for K-12 statewide as well as entry to US tertiary and quaternary education institutions.\n</CONCLUSION>\n<EVALUATE>\n\nLet's think step by step. We want to evaluate if ETS develops assessments for K-12 statewide as well as entry to US tertiary and quaternary educatiand doon institutions. We know that ETS develops assessments for K-12 statewide. We also know that ETS develops assessments associated with entry to the US tertiary and quaternary education institutes. Therefore, both parts of the conclusion are true, and the statement is true.\nANSWER:\tTrue\n</EVALUATE>\n\n---\n<PREMISES>\nChina is one of BRICS and its economy is emerging.\nIndia is one of BRICS and its economy is emerging.\nAll people from China speak Chinese.\nAll people from India speak Hindi or English.\nThere is an Indian.\n</PREMISES>\n<CONCLUSION>\nThere is a person from BRICS speaking Hindi.\n</CONCLUSION>\n<EVALUATE>\n\nLet's think step by step. We want to evaluate if there is a person from BRICS speaking Hindi. We know that there is an Indian, and since India is one of BRICS, we know that there is an Indian in BRICS. Furthermore, we know that they speak either Hindi or English, however, we don't know which one. Therefore, there could be a person in BRICS speaking Hindi, or there could not. Therefore, it is uncertain whether there is a person from BRICS speaking Hindi.\nANSWER:\tUncertain\n</EVALUATE>\n\n---\n\n<PREMISES>\nOn some Mondays at 8 pm, roses are given out on TV.\nEvery rose given out on TV is on the Bachelor.\nEverything on the Bachelor portrays the lives of real people.\nAll shows portraying the lives of real people are reality TV shows.\nBreaking Bad is not a reality TV show.\n</PREMISES>\n<CONCLUSION>\nBreaking Bad is a TV show in which roses are given out on Monday at 8 pm.\n</CONCLUSION>\n<EVALUATE>\n", "raw_generations": ["Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if Breaking Bad is a TV show in which roses are given out on Monday at 8 pm. From premise 4, we know that all shows portraying the lives of real people are reality TV shows. From premise 3, we know that roses are given out on TV on some Mondays at 8 pm. From premise 2, we know that everything on the Bachelor is roses given out on TV. Therefore, we know that Breaking Bad is a show on the Bachelor. From premise 5, we know that Breaking Bad is not a reality TV show. Since the Bachelor is not a reality TV show, it does not have roses given out on Monday at 8 pm. Therefore, Breaking Bad is not a TV show in which roses are given out on Monday at 8 pm, so the statement is false.\nANSWER:\tFalse\n", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if Breaking Bad is a TV show in which roses are given out on Monday at 8 pm. First, let's consider the premises. We know that roses are given out on TV on some Mondays at 8 pm. We also know that everything on the Bachelor portrays the lives of real people and all shows portraying the lives of real people are reality TV shows. However, we also know that Breaking Bad is not a reality TV show, and the premise does not state that roses are given out on the Bachelor specifically on Mondays at 8 pm. Therefore, it is uncertain whether Breaking Bad is a TV show in which roses are given out on Monday at 8 pm.\nANSWER:\tUncertain\n", "Let's think step by step. We need to determine if Breaking Bad is a TV show in which roses are given out on Monday at 8 pm. From premise 1, we know that on some Mondays at 8 pm, roses are given out on TV. From premise 4, we know that Breaking Bad is not a reality TV show. From premise 3, we know that everything on the Bachelor portrays the lives of real people. From premise 2, we know that all shows portraying the lives of real people are reality TV shows. Since Breaking Bad is not a reality TV show, it cannot be a show on the Bachelor, and therefore it cannot be a show in which roses are given out on Monday at 8 pm. The statement is false.\nANSWER:\tFalse\n", "Let's think step by step. First, we know that on some Mondays at 8 pm, roses are given out on TV. Second, we know that every rose given out on TV is on the Bachelor. Combining these two facts, we can conclude that on some Mondays at 8 pm, roses are given out on the Bachelor. Third, we know that everything on the Bachelor portrays the lives of real people. Combining these facts, we can conclude that on some Mondays at 8 pm, roses are given out on a show in which the lives of real people are portrayed. Fourth, we know that all shows portraying the lives of real people are reality TV shows. Combining these facts, we can conclude that on some Mondays at 8 pm, roses are given out on a reality TV show. Fifth, we know that Breaking Bad is not a reality TV show. Combining this fact with the previous fact, we can conclude that Breaking Bad is not a TV show in which roses are given out on some Mondays at 8 pm. Therefore, the statement is false.\nANSWER:\tFalse\n", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if Breaking Bad is a TV show in which roses are given out on Monday at 8 pm. From the first premise, we know that roses are given out on TV on some Mondays at 8 pm. We also know from the second premise that everything on the Bachelor portrays the lives of real people. From the third premise, we know that all shows portraying the lives of real people are reality TV shows. The fourth premise tells us that Breaking Bad is not a reality TV show. Because Breaking Bad is not a reality TV show, it does not follow the pattern established by the premise that roses are given out on TV on Mondays at 8 pm, since roses are given out on TV on Mondays at 8 pm specifically for reality TV shows like the Bachelor. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Breaking Bad is a TV show in which roses are given out on Monday at 8 pm. The statement is false.\nANSWER:\tFalse\n", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if Breaking Bad is a TV show in which roses are given out on Monday at 8 pm. Let's look at the premises: 1. On some Mondays at 8 pm, roses are given out on TV. This premise tells us that roses are given out on TV on some Mondays at 8 pm, but it doesn't tell us anything about the specific TV shows on which roses are given out. 2. Every rose given out on TV is on the Bachelor. This premise tells us that all roses given out on TV are on the Bachelor. This means that roses are given out on the Bachelor on some Mondays at 8 pm, but it still doesn't tell us anything about Breaking Bad. 3. Everything on the Bachelor portrays the lives of real people. This premise tells us that all shows on the Bachelor are reality TV shows, but Breaking Bad is not a reality TV show. This means that Breaking Bad is not a show on the Bachelor. Since Breaking Bad is not on the Bachelor, and roses are given out on the Bachelor, Breaking Bad is not a TV show in which roses are given out on Monday at 8 pm. Therefore, the conclusion is false.\nANSWER:\tFalse\n", "Let's think step by step.

Combining these two pieces of information, we can conclude that roses are given out on the Bachelor on some Mondays at 8 pm.\n\nFrom Premise 3, we know that everything on the Bachelor portrays the lives of real people. From Premise 4, we know that all shows portraying the lives of real people are reality TV shows. Combining these two pieces of information, we can conclude that everything on the Bachelor is a reality TV show.\n\nFrom Premise 5, we know that Breaking Bad is not a reality TV show. Since everything on the Bachelor is a reality TV show, and Breaking Bad is not a reality TV show, we can conclude that Breaking Bad is not on the Bachelor.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that Breaking Bad is not a TV show in which roses are given out on Monday at 8 pm.

From the fifth premise, we know that Breaking Bad is not a reality TV show.\n\nNow, let's analyze the conclusion:\n- The conclusion states that Breaking Bad is a TV show in which roses are given out on Monday at 8 pm.\n\nFrom the premises, we know:\n- Roses are given out on some Mondays at 8 pm on TV.\n- Everything on the Bachelor is a reality TV show.\n- Breaking Bad is not a reality TV show.\n\nSince Breaking Bad is not a reality TV show, it cannot be on the Bachelor. Therefore, Breaking Bad does not involve the roses given out on TV at that time. Thus, the conclusion is false.\n\nANSWER:\tFALSE\n", "Let's think step by step.

All shows portraying the lives of real people are reality TV shows.\n5. Breaking Bad is not a reality TV show.\n\nFrom premise 5, we know that Breaking Bad is not a reality TV show. From premise 4, we know that all shows that portray the lives of real people are reality TV shows. Therefore, if Breaking Bad is not a reality TV show, it cannot portray the lives of real people. From premise 3, we know that everything on the Bachelor portrays the lives of real people. Since Breaking Bad is not a reality TV show, it cannot be on the Bachelor. From premise 2, we know that every rose given out on TV is on the Bachelor. Since Breaking Bad is not on the Bachelor, it cannot be one of the shows where roses are given out on TV.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that Breaking Bad is not a TV show in which roses are given out on Monday at 8 pm. The answer is:\nANSWER: False\n", "Let's think step by step.

We also know that these roses are on the Bachelor. However, we also know that the Bachelor portrays the lives of real people and that all shows portraying the lives of real people are reality TV shows. This implies that the Bachelor and Breaking Bad are reality TV shows. But premise 5 tells us that Breaking Bad is not a reality TV show. This is a contradiction, so we cannot conclude that Breaking Bad is a TV show in which roses are given out on Monday at 8 pm.\nANSWER:\tFalse\n"], "answers": ["False", "Uncertain", "False", "False", "False", "False", "False", "False", "False", "False"], "reference": "False", "time_total": 22.74131417274475, "time_llm": 22.74021887779236, "prompt_length": 8680}

However, the last premise states that Breaking Bad is not a reality TV show. Since all shows portraying the lives of real people are reality TV shows, Breaking Bad cannot be on the Bachelor, as it is not a reality TV show.

Therefore, all shows on the Bachelor are reality TV shows. From premise 1, we know that roses are given out on TV on some Mondays at 8 pm.

A false premise makes the whole implication (if-then statement) true, regardless of what the conclusion states.

From premises 3 and 4, we know that if roses are given out on TV, it is a reality TV show. Since Breaking Bad is not a reality TV show (premise 5), it means that roses are not given out on Breaking Bad.

Everything on the Bachelor portrays the lives of real people. 4. All shows portraying the lives of real people are reality TV shows. 5. Breaking Bad is not a reality TV show. The conclusion is about roses being given out during Breaking Bad, which is not a reality TV show. However, from the premises, we know that reality TV shows only have roses given out on TV, and since Breaking Bad is not a reality TV show, it cannot be on TV. Therefore, the conclusion is true because the antecedent (roses being given out during Breaking Bad) is false. A false antecedent leads to a true statement in a material implication (if P then Q is true if P is false).

Premises 1 and 2 together suggest that the roses given out on TV are specifically from the show \"The Bachelor\".\n2. Premise 3 indicates that \"The Bachelor\" portrays real people's lives.\n3. Premise 4 tells us that any show portraying the lives of real people is a reality TV show.\n4. Premise 5 states that \"Breaking Bad\" is not a reality TV show, which means it does not portray the lives of real people.\n\nNow, let's analyze the conclusion:\n\nThe conclusion states that if roses are given out during \"Breaking Bad,\" then it must be on Monday at 8 pm. However, this conclusion does not logically follow from the premises for several reasons:\n\n- Premise 5 already tells us that \"Breaking Bad\" is not a reality TV show, and since all reality TV shows are on \"The Bachelor\" (Premise 4), \"Breaking Bad\" cannot be on \"The Bachelor\" where the roses are given out (Premise 2).\n- Even if we disregard Premise 5 and assume hypothetically that roses could be given out during \"Breaking Bad,\" there is no direct connection between the roses being given out and the specific time frame mentioned in the conclusion (Monday at 8 pm). The premise only tells us that roses are given out on some Mondays at 8 pm, not that this is the only time they are given out.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises, and the statement is FALSE. However, since we assumed \"Breaking Bad\" could be on \"The Bachelor\" for the sake of the argument, which contradicts Premise 5, the conclusion is actually based on a false premise. Thus, the correct answer is:\n\nANSWER: FALSE\n", "Let's think step by step.

Thus, we cannot conclude that if colorectal cancer is a bile duct cancer or a Cholangiocarcinoma, then colorectal cancer is a bile duct cancer and a mild flu, so the statement is uncertain.\nANSWER:\tUncertain\n", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if if colorectal cancer is a bile duct cancer or a Cholangiocarcinoma, then colorectal cancer is a bile duct cancer and a mild flu. First, we know that all Cholangiocarcinoma is a bile duct cancer. Second, we know that colorectal cancer is a severe cancer. Therefore, colorectal cancer is a deadly disease, and its survival rate is low. We also know that no one with mild flu has a low survival rate. Since colorectal cancer has a low survival rate, it cannot be a mild flu. Therefore, the statement is false.\nANSWER:\tFalse\n", "Let's think step by step. We need to evaluate if \"if colorectal cancer is a bile duct cancer or a Cholangiocarcinoma, then colorectal cancer is a bile duct cancer and a mild flu\" follows from the premises.\nFirst, let's break down the given premises:\n\n1. If something is a deadly disease, then its survival rate is low.\n2. All severe cancers are deadly diseases.\n3. Bile duct cancer is a severe cancer.\n4. All Cholangiocarcinoma is bile duct cancer.\n5. No one with mild flu has a low survival rate.\n6. If colorectal cancer is a bile duct cancer and the survival rate is low, then colorectal cancer is not a bile duct cancer.\n\nFrom Premise 2, we know that severe cancers are deadly diseases. From Premise 3, we know that bile duct cancer is a severe cancer, so bile duct cancer is a deadly disease.\n\nFrom Premise 4, we know that Cholangiocarcinoma is bile duct cancer, so Cholangiocarcinoma is a deadly disease.\n\nFrom Premise 1, we know that if something is a deadly disease, then its survival rate is low.\n\nFrom Premise 5, we know that no one with mild flu has a low survival rate.\n\nNow let's consider the conclusion: \"if colorectal cancer is a bile duct cancer or a Cholangiocarcinoma, then colorectal cancer is a bile duct cancer and a mild flu.\"\n\nWe know from Premise 3 and Premise 4 that colorectal cancer being a bile duct cancer or a Cholangiocarcinoma means colorectal cancer is a deadly disease. Given that a deadly disease has a low survival rate (from Premise 1), colorectal cancer must have a low survival rate.\n\nHowever, Premise 5 tells us that no one with mild flu has a low survival rate. Since colorectal cancer having a low survival rate does not imply that it is a mild flu, the conclusion cannot be derived from the premises.\n\nANSWER:\tFalse\n", "Let's break down the conclusion and premises to see if they are logically consistent.\n\nThe conclusion can be broken down into two parts:\n1. If colorectal cancer is a bile duct cancer, then colorectal cancer is a bile duct cancer.\n2. If colorectal cancer is a Cholangiocarcinoma, then colorectal cancer is a bile duct cancer.\n\nFrom the premises, we know the following:\n1. Bile duct cancer is a severe cancer, and severe cancers are deadly diseases, so bile duct cancer has a low survival rate.\n2. Cholangiocarcinoma is a type of bile duct cancer, so Cholangiocarcinoma also has a low survival rate.\n3. Colorectal cancer is not a bile duct cancer if it has a low survival rate.\n\nCombining these premises, we can infer that colorectal cancer cannot be a bile duct cancer if it has a low survival rate. Therefore, the conclusion \"If colorectal cancer is a bile duct cancer or a Cholangiocarcinoma, then colorectal cancer is a bile duct cancer\" is logically consistent with the premises.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the second part of the conclusion: \"then colorectal cancer is a mild flu.\" From the premises, we know that a mild flu does not have a low survival rate. Since a bile duct cancer has a low survival rate, and a mild flu does not, colorectal cancer cannot be a mild flu.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"If colorectal cancer is a bile duct cancer or a Cholangiocarcinoma, then colorectal cancer is a bile duct cancer and a mild flu\" is not logically consistent with the premises.\n\nANSWER:\tFalse\n", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if \"if colorectal cancer is a bile duct cancer or a Cholangiocarcinoma, then colorectal cancer is a bile duct cancer and a mild flu.\" Let's break down the premise: \"if colorectal cancer is a bile duct cancer and the survival rate is low, then colorectal cancer is not a bile duct cancer.\" This premise is actually contradictory because it says that if a cancer is a bile duct cancer and has a low survival rate, it cannot be a bile duct cancer. So the premise itself is false. However, we also have \"if something is a deadly disease, then its survival rate is low.\" Since severe cancers are deadly diseases, their survival rate is low. Since bile duct cancer is a severe cancer, it has a low survival rate, and therefore is a deadly disease. Bile duct cancer and Cholangiocarcinoma are essentially the same, so \"colorectal cancer is a bile duct cancer or a Cholangiocarcinoma\" means colorectal cancer is a deadly disease, not a mild flu. The conclusion is combining a true statement with an unrelated statement, which makes the overall conclusion false. So the answer is false.\nANSWER:\tFalse\n", "Let's think step by step. The conclusion claims that if colorectal cancer is a bile duct cancer or a Cholangiocarcinoma, then it is a bile duct cancer and a mild flu. From the premises, we know that all severe cancers are deadly diseases and bile duct cancer is a severe cancer, so bile duct cancer is a deadly disease. From the premises, we also know that all Cholangiocarcinoma is bile duct cancer, so if colorectal cancer is a Cholangiocarcinoma, then it is a bile duct cancer. However, the premises also tell us that no one with a mild flu has a low survival rate. This means that a person with a mild flu cannot have a low survival rate. Since colorectal cancer is a deadly disease and has a low survival rate, colorectal cancer cannot be a mild flu.

According to the premises, we know that all Cholangiocarcinomas are bile duct cancers. So if colorectal cancer is not a Cholangiocarcinoma, it must be a bile duct cancer. This first part of the conclusion is true. For the second part, the premises tell us that if colorectal cancer is a bile duct cancer and the survival rate is low, then colorectal cancer is not a bile duct cancer. However, this doesn't help us evaluate the second part of the conclusion, because it doesn't tell us anything about colorectal cancer that isn't a bile duct cancer.

This premise is a bit confusing because if a disease has a low survival rate, it would contradict itself to state that it cannot be a bile duct cancer if it indeed is one.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the conclusion:\n- The conclusion is about colorectal cancer not being a mild flu and not being a Cholangiocarcinoma.\n- It states that under these conditions, colorectal cancer must be either a bile duct cancer or a Cholangiocarcinoma.\n\nStep 3: Determine if the conclusion follows logically:\n- Premise 1 and Premise 2 together imply that a severe cancer (which bile duct cancer is) is a deadly disease with a low survival rate.\n- Premise 4 implies that all Cholangiocarcinoma is a bile duct cancer, which is a deadly disease with a low survival rate.\n- Premise 5 states that a mild flu has a high survival rate, so it is not a deadly disease.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the logical consistency:\n- Premise 6 is logically inconsistent because if a disease has a low survival rate (which it would if it is a deadly disease), it can't simultaneously not be a bile duct cancer if it's indeed one. This premise contradicts the usual logic that would not allow a disease to be a bile duct cancer if it has a low survival rate.\n\nStep 5: Conclude:\n- Given the inconsistency in Premise 6, we cannot use it to help in evaluating the conclusion.\n- Since Premise 6 contradicts the other premises, we must consider the other premises independently.\n- From Premises 1, 2, 3, and 4, we can deduce that if colorectal cancer is a bile duct cancer, it is a deadly disease with a low survival rate.\n- Premise 5 tells us that a mild flu does not have a low survival rate, so colorectal cancer cannot be a mild flu.\n- The conclusion does not depend on Premise 6, as it only talks about colorectal cancer not being a mild flu and not being a Cholangiocarcinoma.\n\nGiven that colorectal cancer being a bile duct cancer or a Cholangiocarcinoma is not contradicted by the premises, and the conclusion does not depend on the inconsistent Premise 6, we can conclude that the conclusion follows logically based on the other premises. However, the conclusion is not necessarily entailed by the premises because it is a conditional statement, and there could be other conditions under which colorectal cancer could be a bile duct cancer or a Cholangiocarcinoma.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is logically consistent with the premises, but we cannot say that it is definitively true based on the information provided.

This premise is contradictory and seems to be a restatement of Premise 1 in a specific context. This premise does not directly help us evaluate the conclusion.\n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion itself:\n- The part \"colorectal cancer is a bile duct cancer or a Cholangiocarcinoma\" is essentially stating that colorectal cancer must be one of these two types.

Since bile duct cancer is a severe cancer (Premise 3), it is a deadly disease. From Premise 4, we know that all Cholangiocarcinoma is bile duct cancer. This means that Cholangiocarcinoma is also a deadly disease.\n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion. It states that if colorectal cancer is not a mild flu and a Cholangiocarcinoma, then colorectal cancer is a bile duct cancer or a Cholangiocarcinoma. This conclusion is logically sound because if colorectal cancer is not a Cholangiocarcinoma (since Cholangiocarcinoma is a type of bile duct cancer), and it is not a mild flu (which is not deadly), then by process of elimination, colorectal cancer must be a bile duct cancer or a Cholangiocarcinoma.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion follows from the premises, and the statement is TRUE.\nANSWER: True\n", "Let's think step by step.

Premise 2 tells us that all severe cancers are deadly diseases, so all severe cancers are deadly diseases with low survival rates. Premise 3 tells us that bile duct cancer is a severe cancer, so bile duct cancer is a deadly disease with low survival rates. Premise 4 tells us that all Cholangiocarcinoma is bile duct cancer, so Cholangiocarcinoma is also a deadly disease with low survival rates.\n\nPremise 5 tells us that no one with mild flu has a low survival rate, so mild flu is not a deadly disease with a low survival rate.\n\nPremise 6 tells us that if colorectal cancer is a bile duct cancer and the survival rate is low, then colorectal cancer is not a bile duct cancer. This premise is not relevant to our conclusion, so we can ignore it.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the conclusion. If colorectal cancer is not a mild flu and a Cholangiocarcinoma, then it is not a disease with a low survival rate, since it is not a deadly disease.

From Premise 5, we know that if colorectal cancer is a bile duct cancer and the survival rate is low, then colorectal cancer is not a bile duct cancer. Since we know that Bile duct cancer is a deadly disease (from the above reasoning), we can infer that colorectal cancer has a low survival rate if it is a bile duct cancer.\n\nNow, let's consider the part of the conclusion that says \"colorectal cancer is a bile duct cancer or a Cholangiocarcinoma.\" From Premise 2, we know that all Cholangiocarcinoma is bile duct cancer. Therefore, if colorectal cancer is a Cholangiocarcinoma, it is also a bile duct cancer.\n\nGiven that colorectal cancer is neither a mild flu nor a Cholangiocarcinoma, and considering the premises, colorectal cancer must be a bile duct cancer because it has a low survival rate (as per Premise 5) and is not a Cholangiocarcinoma (as per the part of the conclusion we are evaluating).\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"If colorectal cancer is not a mild flu and a Cholangiocarcinoma, then colorectal cancer is a bile duct cancer or a Cholangiocarcinoma\" logically follows from the premises, and the statement is true.\n\nANSWER:\tTrue\n", "Let's think step by step.

Therefore, we can conclude that colorectal cancer cannot be a bile duct cancer. Since Cholangiocarcinoma is a bile duct cancer, colorectal cancer cannot be a Cholangiocarcinoma either.

However, the conclusion is considering a situation where colorectal cancer is neither a mild flu nor a Cholangiocarcinoma, not a bile duct cancer.\n\nThe conclusion is essentially stating that colorectal cancer must be a bile duct cancer or a Cholangiocarcinoma if it is not a mild flu and not a Cholangiocarcinoma. This is true because we know that colorectal cancer is not a mild flu (Premise 5), and we know that all Cholangiocarcinomas are bile duct cancers (Premise 4).\n\nTherefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises, and the statement is true.\nANSWER: True\n", "Let's think step by step.

We want to evaluate if Inception is a folk song. We know that Inception is a sci-fi movie. Since all movies are videos and Inception is a movie, it is a video, which means it is visual. On the other hand, we know that all folk songs are songs, and no songs are visual, so no folk songs are visual.

We know from Premise 7 that it is either true that Taylor grew up in a health-conscious childhood home and has a good relationship with her parents, or she did not. If Taylor grew up in a health-conscious home and has a good relationship with her parents, then by Premise 4, she fulfills her nutritional daily intakes. If Taylor fulfills her nutritional daily intakes, then by Premise 6, she visits the gym at least once a day. So, if Taylor grew up in a health-conscious childhood home and has a good relationship with her parents, the conclusion follows that she visits the gym at least once a day.\n\nHowever, Premise 5 also states that if Taylor has a good relationship with her parents, then she does not eat salads regularly. If she does not eat salads regularly, then she does not satisfy Premise 1 or Premise 2. This would mean that she did not grow up in a health-conscious childhood home, which contradicts the part of Premise 7 that states that she either did or did not.\n\nSince Premise 5 directly contradicts Premise 7, we cannot know for sure whether Taylor grew up in a health-conscious childhood home and has a good relationship with her parents, or not. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Taylor visits the gym at least once a day based on the given premises.\n\nANSWER:\tUncertain\n", "Let's think step by step.

All people who eat salads regularly are very conscious about their health and eating habits.\n2. All people who grew up in health-conscious childhood homes eat salads regularly.\n3. All people who fulfill their nutritional daily intakes grew up in health-conscious childhood homes.\n4. If people have good relationships with their parents, then they fulfill their nutritional daily intakes.\n5. If people have good relationships with their parents, then they do not eat salads regularly.\n6.

It is either both true that Taylor grew up in a health-conscious childhood home and she has a good relationship with her parents, or it is true that Taylor neither grew up in a health-conscious childhood home nor has a good relationship with her parents.\n\nFrom the seventh premise, we have two possible scenarios for Taylor:\n\nScenario A: Taylor grew up in a health-conscious childhood home and has a good relationship with her parents.\nScenario B: Taylor neither grew up in a health-conscious childhood home nor has a good relationship with her parents.\n\nIn Scenario A, Taylor grew up in a health-conscious childhood home, which means she eats salads regularly (Premise 2) and fulfills her nutritional daily intakes (Premise 3). Since she fulfills her nutritional daily intakes and has a good relationship with her parents (Premise 4), Taylor visits the gym at least once a day (Premise 6).\n\nIn Scenario B, Taylor neither grew up in a health-conscious childhood home nor has a good relationship with her parents. This means she does not fulfill her nutritional daily intakes (Premise 4) and does not eat salads regularly (Premise 5). In this scenario, we cannot determine if Taylor visits the gym at least once a day, as Premise 6 only states that visiting the gym leads to fulfilling daily nutritional intakes.\n\nConsidering both scenarios, we can conclude that Taylor visits the gym at least once a day if she grew up in a health-conscious childhood home and has a good relationship with her parents. However, we cannot make a definitive conclusion based on the given premises alone.

From premise 5, we know that people who have good relationships with their parents do not eat salads regularly. From premise 6, we know that it is either both true that Taylor grew up in a health-conscious childhood home and she has a good relationship with her parents, or it is true that Taylor neither grew up in a health-conscious childhood home nor has a good relationship with her parents. Combining these facts, we can conclude that Taylor does not visit the gym at least once a day because she does not eat salads regularly and does not fulfill her nutritional daily intakes.

All people who eat salads regularly are very conscious about their health and eating habits.\n2. All people who grew up in health-conscious childhood homes eat salads regularly.\n3. All people who fulfill their nutritional daily intakes grew up in health-conscious childhood homes.\n4.

From premise 5, we know that Taylor does not eat salads regularly. Therefore, Taylor does not fulfill their nutritional daily intakes. From premise 4, we know that if people have good relationships with their parents, they fulfill their nutritional daily intakes. Since Taylor does not fulfill their daily intakes, she does not have a good relationship with her parents. From premise 6, we know that if Taylor visits the gym at least once a day, she always fulfills her daily nutritional intakes. Therefore, Taylor must visit the gym at least once a day.\n\nAnswer: True\n", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if Taylor visits the gym at least once a day. Let's analyze the premises and see what we can conclude about Taylor's gym habits.\n\nPremise 1: All people who eat salads regularly are very conscious about their health and eating habits.\n\nPremise 2: All people who grew up in health-conscious childhood homes eat salads regularly.\n\nPremise 3: All people who fulfill their nutritional daily intakes grew up in health-conscious childhood homes.\n\nPremise 4: If people have good relationships with their parents, then they fulfill their nutritional daily intakes.\n\nPremise 5: If people have good relationships with their parents, then they do not eat salads regularly.\n\nPremise 6: If people visit the gym at least once a day, then they always fulfill their daily nutritional intakes.\n\nPremise 7: It is either both true that Taylor grew up in a health-conscious childhood home and she has a good relationship with her parents, or it is true that Taylor neither grew up in a health-conscious childhood home nor has a good relationship with her parents.\n\nFrom Premise 7, we can infer that Taylor's relationship with her parents is either good (leading to good nutrition habits and not eating salads) or neither (leading to not eating salads due to not growing up in a health-conscious home).\n\nFrom Premise 5, if Taylor has a good relationship with her parents, she does not eat salads. However, from Premise 1, we know that those who eat salads regularly are very conscious about their health and eating habits. This creates a contradiction, as someone cannot be both very conscious about their health and eating habits while not eating salads regularly.\n\nTherefore, the only consistent scenario is that Taylor does not eat salads regularly. This means she does not have to fulfill her nutritional daily intakes, as Premise 3 states that fulfilling daily nutritional intakes is a result of growing up in a health-conscious childhood home and eating salads regularly. Since Taylor doesn't eat salads regularly, she cannot fulfill her nutritional daily intakes, which implies she doesn't visit the gym at least once a day, as Premise 6 states that visiting the gym leads to fulfilling daily nutritional intakes.\n\nSo based on the given premises, we can conclude that Taylor does not visit the gym at least once a day.

From Premise 2, we know that people who grew up in health-conscious childhood homes eat salads regularly. So, if Taylor grew up in a health-conscious childhood home, she would eat salads regularly (Scenario 1).\n\nFrom Premise 4, we know that if people have good relationships with their parents, they fulfill their nutritional daily intakes. From Premise 5, we know that if people have good relationships with their parents, they do not eat salads regularly. So, if Taylor has a good relationship with her parents, she would not eat salads regularly (Scenario 1).\n\nFrom Premise 3, we know that people who fulfill their nutritional daily intakes grew up in health-conscious childhood homes. So, if Taylor grew up in a health-conscious childhood home, she would fulfill her nutritional daily intakes (Scenario 1).\n\nFrom Premise 6, we know that if people visit the gym at least once a day, they always fulfill their daily nutritional intakes. So, if Taylor visits the gym at least once a day, she would fulfill her daily nutritional intakes (Scenario 1).\n\nFrom Premise 7, we know that Taylor must either fall into Scenario 1 or Scenario 2. If Taylor falls into Scenario 1, she fulfills her daily nutritional intakes, and if she visits the gym at least once a day, she would always fulfill her daily nutritional intakes (Scenario 1). So, Taylor visits the gym at least once a day (Conclusion).\n\nIf Taylor falls into Scenario 2, she does not fulfill her daily nutritional intakes, and she does not visit the gym at least once a day (Conclusion).\n\nSince we have evaluated all possible scenarios, we can conclude that Taylor visits the gym at least once a day (Conclusion).\nANSWER: True\n", "Let's think step by step.\n\n1.

We need to evaluate if the conclusion \"Taylor neither grew up in a health-conscious childhood home nor does she visit the gym at least once a day\" is true given the premises. \n\nPremise 1: All people who eat salads regularly are very conscious about their health and eating habits.\nPremise 2: All people who grew up in health-conscious childhood homes eat salads regularly.\nPremise 3: All people who fulfill their nutritional daily intakes grew up in health-conscious childhood homes.\nPremise 4: If people have good relationships with their parents, then they fulfill their nutritional daily intakes.\nPremise 5: If people have good relationships with their parents, then they do not eat salads regularly.\nPremise 6: If people visit the gym at least once a day, then they always fulfill their daily nutritional intakes.\nPremise 7: It is either both true that Taylor grew up in a health-conscious childhood home and she has a good relationship with her parents, or it is true that Taylor neither grew up in a health-conscious childhood home nor has a good relationship with her parents.\n\nTo analyze the conclusion, let's break it down into its two parts:\n1. Taylor neither grew up in a health-conscious childhood home nor does she visit the gym at least once a day.\n\nFrom Premise 7, we have two scenarios to consider:\n- Scenario A: Taylor grew up in a health-conscious childhood home and has a good relationship with her parents.\n- Scenario B: Taylor neither grew up in a health-conscious childhood home nor has a good relationship with her parents.\n\nIn Scenario A:\n- From Premise 2, Taylor would eat salads regularly.\n- From Premise 5, if Taylor has a good relationship with her parents, then she does not eat salads regularly. This is a contradiction, so Scenario A is not possible.\n\nIn Scenario B:\n- Taylor neither grew up in a health-conscious childhood home nor has a good relationship with her parents.\n- From Premise 4, if Taylor has a good relationship with her parents, she would fulfill her nutritional daily intakes. Since she does not have a good relationship with her parents, this part of the premise does not apply.\n- From Premise 5, if Taylor does not have a good relationship with her parents, then she does not eat salads regularly.\n- From Premise 1, if Taylor eats salads regularly, then she is very conscious about her health and eating habits. Since she does not eat salads regularly, this part of the premise does not apply.\n\nNext, we consider whether Taylor visits the gym at least once a day:\n- From Premise 6, if Taylor visits the gym at least once a day, then she always fulfills her daily nutritional intakes. Since Taylor does not have a good relationship with her parents, we cannot directly infer her gym habits from Premise 4 and 5. However, given that Premise 7 restricts Scenario B (Taylor neither grew up in a health-conscious childhood home nor has a good relationship with her parents), it implies that in Scenario B, Taylor cannot fulfill her nutritional daily intakes through other means (like visiting the gym, since Premise 6 indicates gym use leads to fulfilling intakes).\n\nThus, in Scenario B, Taylor neither grew up in a health-conscious childhood home nor visits the gym at least once a day, making the conclusion true under this scenario.\n\nGiven that Scenario A leads to a contradiction and only Scenario B is logically consistent with the premises, we can conclude that the statement \"Taylor neither grew up in a health-conscious childhood home nor does she visit the gym at least once a day\" is TRUE.\n\nANSWER: True\n", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if Taylor neither grew up in a health-conscious childhood home nor does she visit the gym at least once a day. First, we know that Taylor either grew up in a health-conscious childhood home or does not have a good relationship with her parents. If Taylor grew up in a health-conscious childhood home, then she eats salads regularly. According to premise 1, if people have good relationships with their parents, they do not eat salads regularly. This means that if Taylor had grown up in a health-conscious childhood home, she could not have a good relationship with her parents. However, if Taylor does not have a good relationship with her parents, then premise 4 tells us that she does not fulfill her nutritional daily intakes, and premise 5 tells us that if she fulfills her nutritional daily intakes, then she visits the gym at least once a day. Therefore, Taylor cannot fulfill her nutritional daily intakes, which means she does not visit the gym at least once a day. This matches the conclusion we are trying to evaluate. Therefore, Taylor neither grew up in a health-conscious childhood home nor does she visit the gym at least once a day.\nANSWER:\tTrue\n", "Let's think step by step. First, let's summarize what we know from the premises:\nPremise 1: All people who eat salads regularly are very conscious about their health and eating habits.\nPremise 2: All people who grew up in health-conscious childhood homes eat salads regularly.\nPremise 3: All people who fulfill their nutritional daily intakes grew up in health-conscious childhood homes.\nPremise 4: If people have good relationships with their parents, then they fulfill their nutritional daily intakes.\nPremise 5: If people have good relationships with their parents, then they do not eat salads regularly.\nPremise 6: If people visit the gym at least once a day, then they always fulfill their daily nutritional intakes.\nPremise 7: It is either both true that Taylor grew up in a health-conscious childhood home and she has a good relationship with her parents, or it is true that Taylor neither grew up in a health-conscious childhood home nor has a good relationship with her parents.\nNow, let's evaluate the conclusion that Taylor neither grew up in a health-conscious childhood home nor does she visit the gym at least once a day.\nPremise 7 tells us that Taylor either grew up in a health-conscious childhood home and has a good relationship with her parents, or neither grew up in a health-conscious childhood home nor has a good relationship with her parents.\nIf Taylor grew up in a health-conscious childhood home and has a good relationship with her parents, then by Premise 3, she fulfills her nutritional daily intakes, and by Premise 4, she does not eat salads regularly. But Premise 2 tells us that if she grew up in a health-conscious childhood home, she eats salads regularly. This creates a contradiction, so Taylor cannot have grown up in a health-conscious childhood home and have a good relationship with her parents.\nTherefore, Taylor neither grew up in a health-conscious childhood home nor has a good relationship with her parents.\nNow, if Taylor neither grew up in a health-conscious childhood home nor has a good relationship with her parents, then she does not fulfill her nutritional daily intakes by Premise 4, and she eats salads regularly by Premise 5. But Premise 2 tells us that if she eats salads regularly, then she grew up in a health-conscious childhood home. This creates another contradiction, so Taylor cannot neither grow up in a health-conscious childhood home nor have a good relationship with her parents.\nTherefore, Taylor must have grown up in a health-conscious childhood home and has a good relationship with her parents.\nIf Taylor grew up in a health-conscious childhood home and has a good relationship with her parents, then she fulfills her nutritional daily intakes by Premise 4, and she does not eat salads regularly by Premise 5.

However, we also know from the premises that if Taylor fulfills her nutritional daily intakes, she does not eat salads regularly, so this situation is not possible. Therefore, the second statement must be true, meaning Taylor neither grew up in a health-conscious childhood home nor has a good relationship with her parents.\n\nIf Taylor neither grew up in a health-conscious childhood home nor has a good relationship with her parents, then she does not fulfill her nutritional daily intakes, so she does not visit the gym at least once a day. Therefore, the conclusion is true.\n\nANSWER:\tTrue\n", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if Taylor neither grew up in a health-conscious childhood home nor does she visit the gym at least once a day. We know that Taylor has a good relationship with her parents, which means that she fulfills her nutritional daily intakes. Since people who fulfill their nutritional daily intakes grow up in health-conscious childhood homes, we know that Taylor grew up in a health-conscious childhood home. However, we also know that people who eat salads regularly are very conscious about their health and eating habits. Since we know that Taylor fulfills her daily nutritional intakes, we know that she eats salads regularly. However, we also know that people who have good relationships with their parents do not eat salads regularly. This seems to contradict what we know. If Taylor has a good relationship with her parents, then she must not eat salads regularly. But since she grows up in a health-conscious childhood home, she must eat salads regularly. So it is impossible for both of these statements to be true at the same time. Therefore, one of the statements must be false. We know that Taylor grew up in a health-conscious childhood home, so the statement that Taylor does not visit the gym at least once a day is the false one. So the statement that Taylor neither grew up in a health-conscious childhood home nor visits the gym at least once a day is false.\nANSWER:\tFalse\n", "Let's break down the premises and the conclusion step by step:\n\n1. All people who eat salads regularly are very conscious about their health and eating habits.\n2. All people who grew up in health-conscious childhood homes eat salads regularly.\n3. All people who fulfill their nutritional daily intakes grew up in health-conscious childhood homes.\n4. If people have good relationships with their parents, then they fulfill their nutritional daily intakes.\n5. If people have good relationships with their parents, then they do not eat salads regularly.\n6. If people visit the gym at least once a day, then they always fulfill their daily nutritional intakes.\n7. It is either both true that Taylor grew up in a health-conscious childhood home and she has a good relationship with her parents, or it is true that Taylor neither grew up in a health-conscious childhood home nor has a good relationship with her parents.\n\nNow let's evaluate the conclusion: Taylor neither grew up in a health-conscious childhood home nor does she visit the gym at least once a day.\n\nFrom the premises, we know that if Taylor grew up in a health-conscious childhood home, then she would eat salads regularly (premise 2). However, if she has a good relationship with her parents, then she would not eat salads regularly (premise 5). So, it is possible that Taylor grew up in a health-conscious childhood home but does not have a good relationship with her parents, which would mean she eats salads regularly.\n\nNow, considering the seventh premise, it states that it is either both true that Taylor grew up in a health-conscious childhood home and she has a good relationship with her parents, or it is true that Taylor neither grew up in a health-conscious childhood home nor has a good relationship with her parents. This implies that there is no scenario where Taylor both grew up in a health-conscious childhood home and has a good relationship with her parents.\n\nAdditionally, the premise that if people visit the gym at least once a day, then they always fulfill their daily nutritional intakes (premise 6) does not directly relate to the information about Taylor's childhood or her eating habits.\n\nTherefore, based on the seventh premise, we can conclude that Taylor neither grew up in a health-conscious childhood home nor has a good relationship with her parents. This directly supports the conclusion that Taylor neither grew up in a health-conscious childhood home nor visits the gym at least once a day, as not growing up in a health-conscious childhood home implies that she does not eat salads regularly, which is a consequence of the premises provided.\n\nANSWER:\tTrue\n", "Let's think step by step. We know that if Taylor grew up in a health-conscious childhood home, then she either fulfills her nutritional daily intakes, or she visits the gym at least once a day, because people who grew up in health-conscious childhood homes fulfill their nutritional daily intakes, and people who fulfill their nutritional daily intakes visit the gym at least once a day. We also know that if she has a good relationship with her parents, then she fulfills her nutritional daily intakes and does not eat salads regularly. Therefore, if Taylor has a good relationship with her parents, then she fulfills her nutritional daily intakes and does not eat salads regularly, but we do not know if she visits the gym at least once a day. On the other hand, we know that if she neither grew up in a health-conscious childhood home nor has a good relationship with her parents, then it is uncertain if she fulfills her nutritional daily intakes, or visits the gym at least once a day. Therefore, we do not know if Taylor neither grew up in a health-conscious childhood home nor visits the gym at least once a day. The statement is uncertain.\nANSWER:\tUncertain\n", "Let's think step by step. The given statement says that either both Taylor grew up in a health-conscious childhood home and she has a good relationship with her parents are true, or it is true that Taylor neither grew up in a health-conscious childhood home nor has a good relationship with her parents. The first part of the statement implies that Taylor fulfills her daily nutritional intakes (since all people who grew up in health-conscious childhood homes fulfill their nutritional daily intakes). The second part of the statement implies that Taylor does not fulfill her daily nutritional intakes (since people who eat salads regularly do not fulfill their daily nutritional intakes, and people who fulfill their daily nutritional intakes have good relationships with their parents). If the first part of the statement is true, then the second part cannot be true, and vice versa. So, we can conclude that one of these statements is true, and the other one is false. Now, let's consider the conclusion. The conclusion says that Taylor neither grew up in a health-conscious childhood home nor visits the gym at least once a day. If Taylor grew up in a health-conscious childhood home, then she fulfills her daily nutritional intakes and has a good relationship with her parents. If Taylor visits the gym at least once a day, then she always fulfills her daily nutritional intakes. Both of these are contradictory to the second part of the given statement. Therefore, the conclusion is true.\nANSWER:\tTrue\n", " \nLet's think step by step. We want to evaluate whether Taylor neither grew up in a health-conscious childhood home nor visits the gym at least once a day. From the premises, we know that if people have good relationships with their parents, they fulfill their daily nutritional intakes, and if they fulfill their daily nutritional intakes, they eat salads regularly. So, if Taylor has a good relationship with her parents, she eats salads regularly. From another premise, we know that if people have good relationships with their parents, they do not eat salads regularly. So, if Taylor has a good relationship with her parents, she does not eat salads regularly. We also know that if people visit the gym at least once a day, they always fulfill their daily nutritional intakes. From the premises, we know that if people fulfill their daily nutritional intakes, they eat salads regularly. So, if Taylor visits the gym at least once a day, she eats salads regularly. From another premise, we know that if people eat salads regularly, they grew up in a health-conscious childhood home. So, if Taylor visits the gym at least once a day, she grew up in a health-conscious childhood home. From the last premise, we know that either Taylor grew up in a health-conscious childhood home and has a good relationship with her parents, or she neither grew up in a health-conscious childhood home nor has a good relationship with her parents. This means that Taylor cannot both grow up in a health-conscious childhood home and visit the gym at least once a day. Therefore, Taylor must either not grow up in a health-conscious childhood home or not visit the gym at least once a day. Since the conclusion states that Taylor neither grew up in a health-conscious childhood home nor visits the gym at least once a day, the conclusion is true.\nANSWER:\tTrue\n", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate the statement \"Taylor neither grew up in a health-conscious childhood home nor does she visit the gym at least once a day\". Let's consider the given premises:\nPremise 1: All people who eat salads regularly are very conscious about their health and eating habits.\nPremise 2: All people who grew up in health-conscious childhood homes eat salads regularly.\nPremise 3: All people who fulfill their nutritional daily intakes grew up in health-conscious childhood homes.\nPremise 4: If people have good relationships with their parents, then they fulfill their nutritional daily intakes.\nPremise 5: If people have good relationships with their parents, then they do not eat salads regularly.\nPremise 6: If people visit the gym at least once a day, then they always fulfill their daily nutritional intakes.\nPremise 7: It is either both true that Taylor grew up in a health-conscious childhood home and she has a good relationship with her parents, or it is true that Taylor neither grew up in a health-conscious childhood home nor has a good relationship with her parents.\nFrom Premise 2, we know that if someone grew up in a health-conscious childhood home, they eat salads regularly. From Premise 5, we know that if someone has a good relationship with their parents, they do not eat salads regularly. So, if Taylor grew up in a health-conscious childhood home and has a good relationship with her parents, then she would have a contradiction because she would both eat salads regularly and not eat salads regularly. Therefore, Premise 7 tells us that Taylor either did not grow up in a health-conscious childhood home or does not have a good relationship with her parents. If Taylor did not grow up in a health-conscious childhood home, then she does not eat salads regularly, according to Premise 2. From Premise 4, if she fulfills her nutritional daily intakes, then she has a good relationship with her parents, according to Premise 5. Since Premise 3 tells us that people who fulfill their daily nutritional intakes grew up in health-conscious childhood homes, we know that if Taylor fulfills her daily nutritional intakes, she did not grow up in a health-conscious childhood home, and she does not have a good relationship with her parents. So, Taylor does not fulfill her daily nutritional intakes, which means she does not visit the gym at least once a day, according to Premise 6. So, Taylor neither grew up in a health-conscious childhood home nor visits the gym at least once a day, according to Premise 7.\nANSWER:\tTrue\n"], "answers": ["True", "True", "True", "True", "False", "True", "Uncertain", "True", "True", "True"], "reference": "True", "time_total": 141.38904190063477, "time_llm": 141.38537049293518, "prompt_length": 9276}

From premise 4, we know that in La Liga 2021-2022, Real Madrid received more points than Barcelona. Therefore, in La Liga 2021-2022, Real Madrid received more points than Barcelona, so Real Madrid ranks higher than Barcelona, so the statement is true.\nANSWER:\tTrue\n</EVALUATE>\n\n---\n<PREMISES>\nAll athletes are good at sports.\nAll Olympic gold medal winners are good athletes.\nNo scientists are good at sports.\nAll Nobel laureates are scientists.\nAmy is good at sports or Amy is an Olympic gold medal winner.\nIf Amy is not a Nobel laureate, then Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner.\n</PREMISES>\n<CONCLUSION>\nIf Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner, then Amy is a Nobel laureate.\n</CONCLUSION>\n<EVALUATE>\n\nLet's think step by step. We want to evaluate the statement \"if Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner, then Amy is a Nobel laureate\". Let's assume that Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner. This doesn't tell us anything about whether Amy is a Nobel laureate, so the statement isn't true, meaning it is either False or Uncertain. To distinguish between the two, notice that we could have a scenario where Amy is neither an Olympic gold medal winner nor a Nobel laureate. None of the premises are violated in this case.

We want to evaluate if James contributes to the country. Let's think about what we know about James. First, we know that James was either sentenced for thief or stayed in prison. However, this doesn't tell us anything about whether James contributed to the country. Second, we know that James either had a bad record in the local state or that he was respected by others. However, the premises don't tell us anything about the relationship between having a bad record and contributing to the country.

(Some grumpy people are mean to animals)\n3. All animal lovers are nice to animals. (If someone is an animal lover, they are nice to animals)\n4. If someone owns a pet, then they love animals. (Pet owners love animals)\n5. Tom is a pet owner. (Tom owns a pet)\n\nFrom premise 4 and premise 5, we know that Tom loves animals. From premise 3, we know that loving animals means being nice to animals. Therefore, Tom is nice to animals.\n\nNow let's analyze the conclusion: \"if Tom is not a grumpy person and mean to animals, then Tom is neither a grumpy person nor an Animal Lover.\"\n\n- \"Tom is not a grumpy person\": This part of the conclusion is not directly supported or contradicted by the premises.\n- \"Tom is mean to animals\": We know from the premises that Tom is nice to animals, so this part of the conclusion is also not directly supported or contradicted by the premises.\n- \"Tom is an Animal Lover\": We know that Tom loves animals (from premise 4 and 5), so this part of the conclusion is supported by the premises.\n\nSince Tom is an Animal Lover (as shown by the premises), the conclusion that \"Tom is neither a grumpy person nor an Animal Lover\" is false because we have established that Tom is an Animal Lover.\n\nTherefore, the overall statement is false.\nANSWER:\tFalse\n", "Let's think step by step. We are given the following information: \n\n1. No one nice to animals is mean to animals.\n2. Some grumpy people are mean to animals.\n3. All animal lovers are nice to animals.\n4. If someone owns a pet, then they love animals.\n5. Tom is a pet owner.\n\nWe want to evaluate if the conclusion \"If Tom is not a grumpy person and mean to animals, then Tom is neither a grumpy person nor an Animal Lover\" is true given the premises.\n\nFirst, let's break down the conclusion: \"If Tom is not a grumpy person and mean to animals, then Tom is neither a grumpy person nor an Animal Lover.\"\n\n- \"Tom is not a grumpy person\" means Tom is not one of the \"some grumpy people who are mean to animals.\"\n- \"Tom is mean to animals\" means Tom is one of the \"some grumpy people who are mean to animals.\"\n- \"Tom is neither a grumpy person nor an Animal Lover\" means Tom is neither one of the \"some grumpy people who are mean to animals\" nor an \"animal lover.\"\n\nFrom the premises:\n- Since Tom is a pet owner, by premise 4, Tom loves animals (and therefore, Tom is an animal lover).\n- From premise 3, all animal lovers are nice to animals. Thus, Tom is nice to animals.\n\nGiven that Tom is nice to animals:\n- From premise 1, no one nice to animals is mean to animals. Thus, Tom is not mean to animals.\n\nNow let's consider the implication: \"If Tom is not a grumpy person and mean to animals, then Tom is neither a grumpy person nor an Animal Lover.\"\n\n- We already established that Tom is not mean to animals (by being nice to animals).\n- We also know that Tom loves animals (by being an animal lover), so Tom is indeed an animal lover.\n\nFor the implication to hold, Tom must not be a grumpy person. Given that Tom is not mean to animals (and thus not a grumpy person), Tom must not be a grumpy person.\n\nTherefore, if Tom is not a grumpy person and mean to animals, then Tom is neither a grumpy person nor an Animal Lover (since he is an animal lover and not a grumpy person).\n\nThus, the conclusion is TRUE.\n\nANSWER: True\n"], "answers": ["False", "False", "Uncertain", "True", "True", "False", "False", "False", "False", "True"], "reference": "False", "time_total": 35.923537731170654, "time_llm": 35.922221660614014, "prompt_length": 8635}

However, from premise 5, we know that Yuri does not wear large-size clothes. So, we can conclude that Yuri does not wear large shoes and is not tall.

We want to evaluate the statement \"if Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner, then Amy is a Nobel laureate\". Let's assume that Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner. This doesn't tell us anything about whether Amy is a Nobel laureate, so the statement isn't true, meaning it is either False or Uncertain.

If an animal jumps, then Jane likes it.\n4. If an animal has legs, then it jumps.\n5. If an animal is terricolous, then it has legs.\n6. If KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous or has legs.\n\nNow, let's analyze the conclusion: KiKi is terricolous.\n\nWe can use the premises to reason about KiKi's characteristics:\n\n- From premise 6, we know that if KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous or has legs.\n- From premise 4, we know that if an animal has legs, then it jumps.\n- Combining the information from premises 3 and 4, we can infer that if an animal has legs, then Jane likes it (because it jumps).\n- From premise 1, we know that if an animal barks, then Jane does not like it. However, this does not give us any direct information about KiKi since we don't know if KiKi barks.\n- From premise 2, we know that all dogs are animals that bark. Since KiKi is not mentioned as a dog, we cannot infer anything about KiKi's barking behavior from this premise alone.\n- From premise 5, we know that if an animal is terricolous, then it has legs. This premise tells us about the relationship between being terricolous and having legs, but it does not give us any information about KiKi specifically.\n\nConsidering the premises, we do not have enough information to conclude that KiKi is terricolous. We cannot determine KiKi's jumping or leg-holding characteristics, and we cannot infer KiKi's barking behavior from the information given. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that KiKi is terricolous based on the premises provided.\n\nANSWER:\tUncertain\n", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate whether the conclusion that KiKi is terricolous follows from the premises. From premise 4, we know that if an animal has legs, then it jumps. From premise 5, we know that if an animal is terricolous, then it has legs. Combining these two, we can conclude that if an animal is terricolous, then it jumps. From premise 3, we know that if an animal jumps, then Jane likes it. From premise 2, we know that all dogs are animals that bark. And finally, from premise 1, we know that if an animal barks, then Jane does not like it. From all these, we can conclude that KiKi is not a dog, and so it does not bark. So, from premise 5, we can conclude that KiKi either has legs or is terricolous. We already know that KiKi does not have legs from premise 3, so KiKi must be terricolous. Therefore, the conclusion is true.\nANSWER:\tTrue\n", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if KiKi is terricolous. From the last premise, we know that KiKi neither jumps nor has legs. From the third premise, we know that if an animal has legs, then it jumps. Since KiKi does not jump, we know that KiKi does not have legs. Now, since KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, we look at the second premise, which tells us that if an animal jumps, then Jane likes it. We know that KiKi does not jump, so we don't know if Jane likes it. However, we still can't conclude that KiKi is terricolous because the fourth premise states that if an animal is terricolous, then it has legs, and we know that KiKi does not have legs. Therefore, KiKi is not terricolous.\nANSWER:\tFalse\n", "Let's think step by step. From the fourth premise, we know that if an animal has legs, then it jumps. From the fifth premise, we know that if an animal is terricolous, then it has legs. Combining these two, we can deduce that if an animal is terricolous, then it jumps. Now, considering the sixth premise, it says that if KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous or has legs. Since KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, according to the sixth premise, KiKi must be terricolous or have legs. We have already established that if KiKi is terricolous, then it must also have legs and jump, which contradicts the premise that KiKi neither jumps nor has legs. Therefore, KiKi cannot be terricolous. So, KiKi is neither terricolous nor having legs. The conclusion that KiKi is terricolous is false.\n\nANSWER:\tFalse\n", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if KiKi is terricolous. From premise 3, we know that if an animal has legs, then it jumps. From premise 2, we know that all dogs are animals that bark. From premise 1, we know that if an animal barks, then Jane does not like it. From premise 4, we know that if an animal jumps, then Jane likes it. Combining these premises, we can conclude that dogs are animals that Jane likes. From premise 5, we know that if an animal neither jumps nor has legs, then it is terricolous or has legs. Since we know that dogs have legs and jump, this premise doesn't tell us anything about dogs. Therefore, we don't know whether KiKi is terricolous or not, so the statement is uncertain.\nANSWER:\tUncertain\n", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if KiKi is terricolous.

"Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if KiKi is terricolous. The premise \"If an animal jumps, then Jane likes it\" doesn't say anything about terricolous animals. So, we need to focus on the other premises. From \"If an animal has legs, then it jumps\", we know that KiKi has legs (since it's implied KiKi jumps). From \"If an animal is terricolous, then it has legs\", we can deduce that KiKi could be terricolous, but we don't have direct information confirming that KiKi is terricolous. The premise \"KiKi neither jumps nor has legs\" is actually a contradictory statement since we already established from \"If an animal has legs, then it jumps\" that KiKi must jump if it has legs. Therefore, this premise is inconsistent with the given information. Since there are inconsistencies in the premises, we cannot logically conclude whether KiKi is terricolous or not.

We want to evaluate if a worksheet is not dispensable. From premise 6, we know that a worksheet is either paper or is environment-friendly. If it is paper, then from premise 3, a worksheet is woodware, and from premise 2, a worksheet is dispensable.

If KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous or has legs.\n\nNow, let's analyze the conclusion:\nKiKi neither barks nor is a dog.\n\nFrom Premise 2, we know that all dogs bark. Therefore, if KiKi is a dog, KiKi must bark. This means that KiKi cannot be a dog if KiKi does not bark.\n\nFrom Premise 1, we know that if an animal barks, then Jane does not like it. However, this information does not directly relate to KiKi's barking or non-barking status in the conclusion.\n\nNow, let's consider Premise 6.

From the sixth premise, if KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous or has legs. From the first premise, if KiKi jumps, then Jane likes it. From the fourth premise, if KiKi has legs, then it jumps. Therefore, if KiKi is a terricolous dog, then Jane would not like it (because all dogs bark and KiKi would be a terricolous dog).

Now let's consider the conclusion: KiKi neither barks nor is a dog. We know from premise 2 that if KiKi is a dog, KiKi barks.

From premise 6, we know that if KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous or has legs. Since KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, this means that KiKi must be terricolous. From premise 1, we know that if an animal barks, then Jane does not like it. Since KiKi is terricolous and terricolous animals have legs, KiKi must jump.

According to premise 4, if an animal does not jump and does not have legs, then it is terricolous. Therefore, KiKi is terricolous, which means it does not jump or have legs.

We know that if an animal has legs, then it jumps. And we know that if an animal is terricolous, then it has legs. So, if KiKi has legs, then KiKi jumps, and if KiKi is terricolous, then KiKi has legs and jumps. We also know that if KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous or has legs. Therefore, if KiKi is a dog, then KiKi barks and Jane does not like it. And if KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous or has legs.

We want to evaluate if KiKi neither barks nor is a dog.\n\nPremise 1 states that if an animal barks, then Jane does not like it. Premise 2 states that all dogs are animals that bark. From Premise 2, we can infer that if an animal is a dog, then Jane does not like it because they bark. Premise 3 states that if an animal jumps, then Jane likes it. Premise 4 states that if an animal has legs, then it jumps. Premise 5 states that if an animal is terricolous, then it has legs. Premise 6 states that if KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous or has legs. From Premise 4 and 5, we know that if KiKi is terricolous, then KiKi has legs. This means that if KiKi is terricolous, then KiKi jumps (because KiKi has legs and animals that have legs jump) and Jane likes it (because animals that jump are liked by Jane). So KiKi being terricolous contradicts KiKi neither jumping nor having legs. From Premise 6, we know that if KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous or has legs, but we already know that KiKi cannot be terricolous. Therefore, KiKi must have legs, and from Premise 4, we know that KiKi jumps. This means that KiKi neither barks nor is a dog (because if KiKi were a dog, it would bark, and Jane would not like it). Therefore, the conclusion that KiKi neither barks nor is a dog follows from the premises. The answer is True.\nANSWER: True\n", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if KiKi neither barks nor is a dog. First, let's examine the premises. From the fourth premise, we know that if an animal has legs, then it jumps. From the second premise, we know that all dogs are animals that bark. Since KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, the third premise tells us that KiKi is terricolous. From the first premise, we know that if an animal barks, then Jane does not like it. Since dogs are animals that bark, and KiKi is terricolous and does not jump, we can infer that KiKi does not bark (because dogs bark). Therefore, KiKi is neither barks nor is a dog. The statement is true.\nANSWER:\tTrue\n", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if KiKi neither barks nor is a dog.

This means that if KiKi is a dog, KiKi must bark. However, we are given in Premise 6 that KiKi neither jumps nor has legs. According to Premise 5, if KiKi is terricolous, then KiKi has legs. This is a contradiction because KiKi does not have legs.\n\nThe contradiction implies that KiKi cannot be terricolous. Since KiKi does not have legs, according to Premise 4, KiKi cannot jump either. However, since KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, Premise 6 tells us that KiKi must be terricolous, but this contradicts our earlier finding that KiKi cannot be terricolous.\n\nThe contradiction suggests that there is a mistake in our reasoning, as KiKi cannot be both terricolous and not terricolous at the same time. This means that the premise \"If KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous or has legs\" cannot be true, and therefore KiKi cannot be terricolous or have legs.\n\nSince KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, and KiKi is not terricolous, KiKi must not be a dog because all dogs bark and KiKi does not bark.
