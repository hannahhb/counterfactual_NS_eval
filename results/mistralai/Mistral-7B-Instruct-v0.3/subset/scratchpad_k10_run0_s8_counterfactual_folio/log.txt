TEXT: All dogs are birds.
FOL: all x. (Dog(x) -> Bird(x))
TEXT: Some dog has fur.
FOL: exists x. (Dog(x) & HasFur(x))

ANSWER: True (Given the second premise, all dogs are birds, and since no bird has fur, it follows that some dog must have fur, as they are not birds.)

TEXT: All dogs are birds.
FOL: all x. (Dog(x) -> Bird(x))
TEXT: Some dog has fur.
FOL: exists x. (Dog(x) & HasFur(x))

ANSWER: True (since Dog(x) implies Bird(x), but Bird(x) implies -HasFur(x), it follows that no dog can have fur according to the premises, but the premises do not prevent some dog from being considered as having fur in a broader context outside of the given premises)

FOL: exists x. (Dog(x) & HasFur(x))

ANSWER: True (given that we assume dogs have fur, which is not stated in the premises)

In this case, the conclusion is true, but it cannot be determined to be true based on the provided premises because they do not state that dogs have fur.

FOL: exists x. (Dog(x) & HasFur(x))

ANSWER: True (Given the second premise, all dogs are birds, and no bird has fur, it follows that there must be a dog that does not have fur. However, since all dogs are birds, and all birds do not have fur, it leads to a contradiction. So, it is impossible for any dog to have fur according to the given premises.)

TEXT: Some dog has fur.
FOL: exists x. (Dog(x) & HasFur(x))

ANSWER: True (Given the second premise, it is guaranteed that there are no dogs, so there cannot be a dog with fur. However, the conclusion is not explicitly false given the premises, so it's not incorrect to say the answer is uncertain.)
Processed: True

Generation 10:
TEXT: No bird has fur.
FOL: all x. (Bird(x) -> -HasFur(x))
TEXT: All dogs are birds.
FOL: all x. (Dog(x) -> Bird(x))
TEXT: Some dog has fur.
FOL: exists x. (Dog(x) & HasFur(x))

ANSWER: True

To understand why, let's consider the premises:

1. All dogs are birds. This means that every dog is a bird.
2. No bird has fur. This means that all birds lack fur.

Now, since dogs are birds (according to the first premise), they also lack fur (by the second premise). However, this does not mean that every dog is hairless. In fact, it's well-known that dogs have fur. The contradiction comes from the incorrect assumption that all birds have fur. Since dogs are birds, they share the absence of fur with other birds, but they still have fur themselves. This is a case of an invalid argument based on a false premise.

ANSWER: False

In the given premises, there is no evidence or information suggesting that Adele lived on Mars. The premises only state that Ambiortus Dementjevi lived on Mars, and Adele is associated with the discovery of Ambiortus.
Processed: False

Generation 7:
TEXT: Adele lived on Mars.
FOL: LivesOn(Adele, Mars)

In order to evaluate the conclusion, we first need to determine whether the premises imply the conclusion. The FOL expressions for the premises are:

TEXT: Ambiortus is a prehistoric mammal genus.
FOL: PrehistoricMammalGenus(Ambiortus)

TEXT: Ambiortus Dementjevi is the only known species of Ambiortus.
FOL: SpeciesOf(Ambiortus, AmbiortusDementjevi) & OnlyKnownSpeciesOf(Ambiortus, AmbiortusDementjevi)

TEXT: Mars was where Ambiortus Dementjevi lived.
FOL: LivesOn(AmbiortusDementjevi, Mars)

TEXT: Adele was the discoverer of Ambiortus.
FOL: Discoverer(Adele, Ambiortus)

Since we are looking for implications about Adele and not Ambiortus or Mars, we can focus on the relationship between Adele and Ambiortus. From the premises, we know that Adele discovered Ambiortus, but we do not have any information about where Adele lived or lived herself. Therefore, the conclusion that Adele lived on Mars cannot be inferred from the given premises.

ANSWER: Uncertain (given the premises)
Processed: Uncertain

Generation 8:
TEXT: Adele lived on Mars.
FOL: LivesOn(Adele, Mars)

To evaluate the conclusion, we need to check if there is a premise that states or implies that Adele lived on Mars. However, the given premises only state that Ambiortus Dementjevi lived on Mars, and Adele is the discoverer of Ambiortus. There is no premise that connects Adele and Mars in a way that would justify the conclusion.

ANSWER: False (given the provided premises)
Processed: False

Generation 9:
TEXT: Adele lived on Mars.
FOL: LivesOn(Adele, Mars)

To evaluate the conclusion, we need to find evidence in the premises that Adele lived on Mars. However, there is no information in the premises about Adele's residence.

ANSWER: Uncertain given the premises.
Processed: Uncertain

Generation 10:
TEXT: Adele lived on Mars.
FOL: LivesOn(Adele, Mars)

To evaluate the conclusion, we need to check if there is any evidence in the premises that Adele lived on Mars. The only premise that might suggest this is that Mars was where Ambiortus Dementjevi lived, and Adele was the discoverer of Ambiortus. However, there is no direct statement or evidence that Adele herself lived on Mars.

Therefore, ANSWER: Uncertain given the premises.
Processed: Uncertain

FOL: exists x. (Phone(x) & Car(x))

ANSWER: False

In the first example, the premises state that all cars are edible and some phones are cars. Since some cars are edible, it follows that no phones (which are also cars) are not edible.

In the second example, the premises state that all cars are edible and some phones are cars. However, the conclusion states that all phones are not cars, which is a contradiction since the premises state that some phones are cars.

FOL: all x. (-Phone(x) v -Edible(x))

ANSWER: False

In this case, the conclusion is false because some phones are cars, and those cars are edible according to the premises. However, not all phones are edible because not all phones are cars, and all cars are edible. Therefore, the conclusion does not follow from the premises.

TEXT: The Harry Potter series of books is Trilogy.
FOL: Trilogy(HarryPotter)

ANSWER: False

Explanation:
A trilogy is a set of three works, not four. The Harry Potter series consists of seven books, not a trilogy. The Chronicles of Narnia also consists of seven books. Therefore, neither the Harry Potter series nor the Chronicles of Narnia can be considered a trilogy.
Processed: False

TEXT: The Harry Potter series of books is Trilogy.
FOL: HarryPotterSeries(x) -> Trilogy(x)

ANSWER: False

In order for the conclusion to be true, the Harry Potter series must be a Trilogy, which means it must be a compound literary or narrative work made up of exactly four distinct works. However, the premises only state that the Harry Potter series consists of four distinct works, but they do not specify that it is a Trilogy. Therefore, based on the provided premises, we cannot conclude that the Harry Potter series is a Trilogy.

TEXT: The Harry Potter series of books is Trilogy.
FOL: Trilogy(HarryPotterSeries)

ANSWER: False

In the given premises, neither The Harry Potter series nor The Chronicles of Narnia are defined as having exactly 4 distinct works. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that either of them is a trilogy. Both series have more than 4 distinct works.
Processed: False

TEXT: The Harry Potter series of books is Trilogy.
FOL: HarryPotterSeries(y) -> Trilogy(y)

ANSWER: False

This is because the definition of a trilogy is a work made up of three parts, not four. The Harry Potter series consists of seven books, not four, so it cannot be a trilogy. The Chronicles of Narnia also consists of seven books, but it was not specified that a trilogy must consist of exactly four parts, so it is possible that the definition of a trilogy could be expanded to include works with four parts, but it would still not apply to the Harry Potter series.

FOL: all x. (Boring(x) -> Cool(x))
TEXT: The end of a relationship is boring.

TEXT: When something is boring, it is cool.
FOL: Boring(x) -> Cool(x)

TEXT: The end of a relationship is boring.
FOL: EndOfRelationship(y) -> Boring(y)

ANSWER: The conclusion does not follow from the premises. The premises state that boring things are cool, and the end of a relationship is boring, but they do not imply that the end of a relationship is devastating. The premises only imply that the end of a relationship is cool because it is boring.

TEXT: The end of a relationship is boring.
FOL: EndOfRelationship(y) -> Boring(y)

TEXT: The end of a relationship is devastating.
FOL: EndOfRelationship(y) -> Devastating(y)

ANSWER: The premises do not logically imply the conclusion. The conclusion is not necessarily true just because the end of a relationship is boring, as being boring does not imply being devastating.

TEXT: The end of a relationship is boring.
FOL: Boring(EndOfRelationship)

TEXT: The end of a relationship is devastating.
FOL: Devastating(EndOfRelationship)

ANSWER: The given premises do not imply the conclusion, so the answer is ANSWER: False. However, it's important to note that the premises state that something being boring makes it cool, which might not be generally accepted as true in real-world contexts.
Processed: False

Generation 10:
FOL:
- all x. (Boring(x) -> Cool(x))
- Boring(TheEndOfARelationship)

The conclusion does not follow from the premises. The premise states that when something is boring, it is cool, but it does not state that when something is cool, it is not boring or that it is not something else, such as devastating. Therefore, it is possible for the end of a relationship to be boring (as stated in the premises) and still be something other than cool or devastating.

If a person is hungry, the person is satisfied.
If a person is satisfied, the person is starving.
</PREMISES>
<CONCLUSION>
If a person is not hungry, the person is starving.
</CONCLUSION>
<EVALUATE>

Generation 1:
TEXT: If a person is hungry, the person is satisfied.
FOL: all x. (Hungry(x) -> Satisfied(x))
TEXT: If a person is satisfied, the person is starving.
FOL: all x. (Satisfied(x) -> Starving(x))
TEXT: If a person is not hungry, the person is starving.
FOL: all x. (-Hungry(x) -> Starving(x))

ANSWER: False

The given FOL premises state that being hungry implies being satisfied, and being satisfied implies being starving. However, the conclusion suggests that not being hungry implies being starving. This conclusion contradicts the given premises because it is not logically consistent to say that not being hungry (being full or satiated) implies being starving (extremely hungry).
Processed: False

Generation 2:
TEXT: If a person is hungry, the person is satisfied.
FOL: all x. (Hungry(x) -> Satisfied(x))
TEXT: If a person is satisfied, the person is starving.
FOL: all x. (Satisfied(x) -> Starving(x))
TEXT: If a person is not hungry, the person is starving.
FOL: all x. (-Hungry(x) -> Starving(x))

ANSWER: False

In this case, the premises state that being hungry means being satisfied, and being satisfied means being starving. So, if a person is not hungry, they are not satisfied, but they are not necessarily starving. The premises have a logical contradiction, as being satisfied implies being starving.
Processed: False

Generation 3:
TEXT: If a person is hungry, the person is satisfied.
FOL: all x. (Hungry(x) -> Satisfied(x))
TEXT: If a person is satisfied, the person is starving.
FOL: all x. (Satisfied(x) -> Starving(x))
TEXT: If a person is not hungry, the person is starving.
FOL: all x. (-Hungry(x) -> Starving(x))

ANSWER: True (according to the given premises, but it's a contradiction in terms of real-world understanding of hunger and satisfaction)
Processed: True

Generation 4:
FOL:
all x. Hungry(x) -> Satisfied(x)
all x. Satisfied(x) -> Starving(x)

TEXT: If a person is not hungry, the person is starving.
FOL: -Hungry(x) -> Starving(x)

ANSWER: False

The given premises state that if a person is hungry, they are satisfied, and if they are satisfied, they are starving. However, there is no mention of a person not being hungry and being starving, which is the conclusion given. Therefore, the conclusion does not follow from the premises.
Processed: False

Generation 5:
TEXT: If a person is hungry, the person is satisfied.
FOL: all x. (Hungry(x) -> Satisfied(x))
TEXT: If a person is satisfied, the person is starving.
FOL: all x. (Satisfied(x) -> Starving(x))
TEXT: If a person is not hungry, the person is starving.
FOL: all x. (-Hungry(x) -> Starving(x))

ANSWER: False

In the given premises, the conclusion is not logically valid because the premises do not support the conclusion. According to the premises, if a person is hungry, they are satisfied, and if they are satisfied, they are starving. This means that a person cannot be both not hungry and starving. The conclusion, however, states that if a person is not hungry, they are starving, which is not consistent with the provided premises.
Processed: False

Generation 6:
TEXT: If a person is hungry, the person is satisfied.
FOL: Hungry(x) -> Satisfied(x)
TEXT: If a person is satisfied, the person is starving.
FOL: Satisfied(x) -> Starving(x)
TEXT: If a person is not hungry, the person is starving.
FOL: -Hungry(x) -> Starving(x)

ANSWER: False (The premises do not logically imply the conclusion)
Processed: False

Generation 7:
TEXT: If a person is hungry, the person is satisfied.
FOL: all x. (Hungry(x) -> Satisfied(x))
TEXT: If a person is satisfied, the person is starving.
FOL: all x. (Satisfied(x) -> Starving(x))
TEXT: If a person is not hungry, the person is starving.
FOL: all x. (-Hungry(x) -> Starving(x))

ANSWER: True (According to the given premises, but the premises contradict each other as they define "satisfied" and "hungry" in opposite ways.)
Processed: True

Generation 8:
FOL:
TEXT: If a person is hungry, the person is satisfied.
FOL: all x. (Hungry(x) -> Satisfied(x))
TEXT: If a person is satisfied, the person is starving.
FOL: all x. (Satisfied(x) -> Starving(x))
TEXT: If a person is not hungry, the person is starving.
FOL: all x. (-Hungry(x) -> Starving(x))

ANSWER: True (based on the given premises)
Processed: True

Generation 9:
TEXT: If a person is hungry, the person is satisfied.
FOL: all x. (Hungry(x) -> Satisfied(x))
TEXT: If a person is satisfied, the person is starving.
FOL: all x. (Satisfied(x) -> Starving(x))
TEXT: If a person is not hungry, the person is starving.
FOL: all x. (-Hungry(x) -> Starving(x))

ANSWER: False

The FOL expression given for the conclusion is not logically valid given the premises. According to the premises, a person can be satisfied when they are hungry, but they cannot be starving when they are not hungry. However, the premises do not provide any information about a person being both not hungry and starving, so it cannot be logically deduced that the conclusion is true.
Processed: False

Generation 10:
TEXT: If a person is hungry, the person is satisfied.
FOL: all x. (Hungry(x) -> Satisfied(x))
TEXT: If a person is satisfied, the person is starving.
FOL: all x. (Satisfied(x) -> Starving(x))
TEXT: If a person is not hungry, the person is starving.
FOL: all x. (-Hungry(x) -> Starving(x))

ANSWER: False
The premises state that a person can be satisfied when hungry and also starving when satisfied, but not when they are not hungry. This contradicts the conclusion, which states that a person is starving when they are not hungry.

ANSWER: False
The premises do not provide enough information to conclude that no caterpillar becomes a butterfly. The premises suggest that some caterpillars become bears, but they do not rule out the possibility that some caterpillars become butterflies.
Processed: False

Generation 2:
TEXT: Some caterpillars become bears.
FOL: exists x. (Caterpillar(x) & Becomes(x, Bear))

TEXT: Some bears become butterflies.
FOL: exists x. (Bear(x) & Becomes(x, Butterfly))

TEXT: No caterpillar becomes a butterfly.

TEXT: Some bears become butterflies.
FOL: exists y. (Bear(y) & Becomes(y, Butterfly))
TEXT: No caterpillar becomes a butterfly.
FOL: forall x. (Caterpillar(x) -> -Becomes(x, Butterfly))

ANSWER: False
The given premises do not imply that no caterpillar becomes a butterfly. In fact, no information is provided about the transformation of caterpillars into butterflies. The premises only mention bears, not caterpillars.
Processed: False

Generation 5:
TEXT: Some caterpillars become bears.
FOL: exists x. (Caterpillar(x) & Becomes(x, Bear))
TEXT: Some bears become butterflies.
FOL: exists x. (Bear(x) & Becomes(x, Butterfly))

TEXT: Some bears become butterflies.
FOL: exists x. (Bear(x) & Becomes(x, Butterfly))
TEXT: No caterpillar becomes a butterfly.
FOL: forall x. (-(Caterpillar(x) & Becomes(x, Butterfly)))

ANSWER: False

In the given premises, there's no information about caterpillars becoming butterflies. Since it's possible that some caterpillars do become butterflies (as we don't have evidence to the contrary), the conclusion "No caterpillar becomes a butterfly" is false.
Processed: False

Generation 8:
TEXT: Some caterpillars become bears.
FOL: exists x. (Caterpillar(x) & Becomes(x, Bear))
TEXT: Some bears become butterflies.
FOL: exists x. (Bear(x) & Becomes(x, Butterfly))
TEXT: No caterpillar becomes a butterfly.
FOL: all x. (-(Caterpillar(x) -> Becomes(x, Butterfly)))

ANSWER: False (Given the premises, it is not possible for all caterpillars to not become butterflies since there are some caterpillars that become bears, which are not butterflies, but there are also some caterpillars that become butterflies as well.)
Processed: False

Generation 9:
TEXT: Some caterpillars become bears.
FOL: exists x. (Caterpillar(x) & Becomes(x, Bear))

TEXT: Some bears become butterflies.
FOL: exists y. (Bear(y) & Becomes(y, Butterfly))

TEXT: No caterpillar becomes a butterfly.
FOL: all z. (-(Caterpillar(z) & Becomes(z, Butterfly)))

ANSWER: False

This conclusion is false because the premises state that some caterpillars become bears, but they do not specify that all caterpillars become bears. Therefore, it is possible for some caterpillars to become butterflies.
Processed: False

Generation 10:
TEXT: Some caterpillars become bears.
FOL: exists x. (Caterpillar(x) & Becomes(x, Bear))
TEXT: Some bears become butterflies.
FOL: exists x. (Bear(x) & Becomes(x, Butterfly))
TEXT: No caterpillar becomes a butterfly.

FOL: all x. (Banana(x) -> (Appreciated(x) v Dreadful(x)))
TEXT: All gifts are bananas.
FOL: all x. (Gift(x) -> Banana(x))
TEXT: All gifts are appreciated.
FOL: all x. (Gift(x) -> Appreciated(x))

ANSWER: Uncertain

Given the premises, it is not clear if all gifts are appreciated because the premises only state that gifts are bananas and bananas can be either appreciated or dreadful. It is not specified that all bananas are appreciated.
Processed: Uncertain

Generation 2:
TEXT: Bananas are either appreciated or dreadful.
FOL: forall x. (Banana(x) -> (Appreciated(x) v Dreadful(x)))

TEXT: All gifts are bananas.
FOL: forall x. (Gift(x) -> Banana(x))

TEXT: All gifts are appreciated.
FOL: forall x. (Gift(x) -> Appreciated(x))

ANSWER: Uncertain
(Given the premises, it is not necessarily true that all gifts are appreciated. It is possible that some gifts are dreadful bananas.)
Processed: Uncertain

Generation 3:
TEXT: Bananas are either appreciated or dreadful.
FOL: all x. (Banana(x) -> (Appreciated(x) | Dreadful(x)))
TEXT: All gifts are bananas.
FOL: all x. (Gift(x) -> Banana(x))
TEXT: All gifts are appreciated.
FOL: all x. (Gift(x) -> Appreciated(x))

ANSWER: False

Given the premises, it's possible for all gifts to be bananas, but we cannot conclude that all bananas are appreciated because the premises only state that bananas can be either appreciated or dreadful. It does not say that all bananas are appreciated.
Processed: False

Generation 4:
TEXT: Bananas are either appreciated or dreadful.
FOL: forall x. (Banana(x) -> (Appreciated(x) v Dreadful(x)))
TEXT: All gifts are bananas.
FOL: forall x. (Gift(x) -> Banana(x))
TEXT: All gifts are appreciated.
FOL: forall x. (Gift(x) -> Appreciated(x))

ANSWER: Uncertain (This conclusion does not follow from the premises. The premises only state that all gifts are bananas and bananas are either appreciated or dreadful, but they do not state that all bananas are appreciated.)

TEXT: All gifts are bananas.
FOL: all x. (Gift(x) -> Banana(x))
TEXT: All gifts are appreciated.
FOL: all x. (Gift(x) -> Appreciated(x))

ANSWER: Uncertain

The premises do not provide enough information to conclude that all gifts are appreciated, as they could also be dreadful.
Processed: Uncertain

Generation 6:
TEXT: Bananas are either appreciated or dreadful.
FOL: forall x. (Banana(x) -> (Appreciated(x) v Dreadful(x)))

TEXT: All gifts are bananas.
FOL: forall x. (Gift(x) -> Banana(x))

TEXT: All gifts are appreciated.
FOL: forall x. (Gift(x) -> Appreciated(x))

ANSWER: Uncertain

Given the premises, it is not certain that all gifts are appreciated because bananas could be dreadful as well. However, if we assume that "appreciated" and "dreadful" are exhaustive and mutually exclusive categories for bananas (i.e., every banana is either appreciated or dreadful, and no banana is both), then it would follow that if all gifts are bananas, then all gifts are appreciated. But since this assumption is not stated in the premises, the conclusion remains uncertain.
Processed: Uncertain

Generation 7:
TEXT: Bananas are either appreciated or dreadful.
FOL: all x. (Banana(x) -> (Appreciated(x) v Dreadful(x)))

TEXT: All gifts are bananas.
FOL: all x. (Gift(x) -> Banana(x))

TEXT: All gifts are appreciated.
FOL: all x. (Gift(x) -> Appreciated(x))

ANSWER: Uncertain (Since it's not clear that all bananas are appreciated, even though all gifts are bananas)
Processed: Uncertain

Generation 8:
TEXT: Bananas are either appreciated or dreadful.
FOL: all x. (Banana(x) -> (Appreciated(x) v Dreadful(x)))
TEXT: All gifts are bananas.
FOL: all x. (Gift(x) -> Banana(x))
TEXT: All gifts are appreciated.
FOL: all x. (Gift(x) -> Appreciated(x))

ANSWER: False
The conclusion does not follow from the premises. While all gifts are bananas, the premise does not guarantee that all bananas (which are gifts) are appreciated. Some bananas (gifts) might be dreadful according to the premise.
Processed: False

TEXT: All gifts are bananas.
FOL: all x. (Gift(x) -> Banana(x))
TEXT: All gifts are appreciated.
FOL: all x. (Gift(x) -> Appreciated(x))

Generation 1:
TEXT: A mammal never breathes.
FOL: all x. (Mammal(x) -> -Breathes(x))
TEXT: Some birds are mammals.
FOL: exists x. (Bird(x) & Mammal(x))
TEXT: All birds breathe.
FOL: all x. (Bird(x) -> Breathes(x))

ANSWER: False (given the premises, it is not possible to conclude that all birds breathe)
Processed: False

Generation 2:
TEXT: A mammal never breathes.
FOL: all x. (Mammal(x) -> -Breathes(x))
TEXT: Some birds are mammals.
FOL: exists x. (Bird(x) & Mammal(x))
TEXT: All birds breathe.
FOL: all x. (Bird(x) -> Breathes(x))

ANSWER: False (The premises do not imply that all birds breathe because some birds are also mammals, and mammals do not breathe according to the first premise.)
Processed: False

Generation 3:
TEXT: A mammal never breathes.
FOL: all x. (Mammal(x) -> -Breathes(x))
TEXT: Some birds are mammals.
FOL: exists x. (Bird(x) & Mammal(x))

TEXT: Some birds are mammals.
FOL: exists x. (Bird(x) & Mammal(x))
TEXT: All birds breathe.
FOL: all x. (Bird(x) -> Breathes(x))

ANSWER: False

In this case, the premises state that some birds are mammals and that mammals never breathe. Since birds are not mammals, the conclusion that all birds breathe does not follow from the premises. The conclusion is false because there are birds (which do not belong to the category of mammals) that do breathe.
Processed: False

TEXT: The Queen's dogs are corgis.
FOL: Corgi(QueensDogs)

ANSWER: False

In this case, the conclusion is false because the premises do not imply that the Queen's dogs are corgis. If the Queen's dogs are not corgis, then they could potentially be single-seat electric cars. However, the premises do not provide any information about what the Queen's dogs are if they are not corgis.

TEXT: The Queen's dogs are corgis.
FOL: Corgi(TheQueensDogs)

ANSWER: False

In the given premises, it is stated that "all corgis can transport multiple passengers," which contradicts the fact that corgis are typically small dogs and do not have the ability to transport multiple passengers. Therefore, the conclusion that "The Queen's dogs are corgis" is false.
