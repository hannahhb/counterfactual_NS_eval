If Y & C is true, then Y is true, so S is true. Since Y & C is true, C is true, so ~S is true. This is a contradiction. Therefore, Y & C cannot be true.\nIf ~Y is true, we don't know anything.\n\nLet's look at the premises. From 2, we have P v I. If P is true, then A is true (from 1). If I is true, then C is true (from 4).\nFrom 3, C -> ~S. From 5, Y -> S. From 6, (A & S) v (~A & ~S).\n\nConsider the case where Bonnie is a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities (Y). Then, she is a student who attends the school (S).\nConsider the case where Bonnie is not a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities (~Y).\n\nIf Bonnie chaperones high school dances (C), then she is not a student who attends the school (~S). Also, since I -> C, we can't say that Bonnie is inactive and disinterested.\nIf Bonnie does not chaperone high school dances (~C), then we don't know anything.\n\nIf Bonnie is a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities (Y) and chaperones high school dances (C), then she is a student who attends the school (S) and is not a student who attends the school (~S), which is a contradiction. So this case is not possible.\n\nIf Bonnie is not a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities (~Y), then we don't know anything.\n\nThe conclusion is equivalent to saying that either Bonnie is a student or Bonnie is an inactive member of the community.\n\nLet's try to find a counterexample. Suppose Bonnie is not a student and is not an inactive member of the community. Then, the conclusion is false.\nSuppose Bonnie is a student.\nSuppose Bonnie is an inactive member of the community.\n\nSince we are unable to find a counterexample, we can assume that the statement is true.\n\nANSWER: True\n", "Let's think step by step. This is a complex logical argument. Let's break it down.\nLet:\nP = Perform in school talent shows often\nE = Attend and are very engaged with school events\nI = Inactive and disinterested member of their community\nC = Chaperone high school dances\nS = Student who attends the school\nA = Young child or teenager who wishes to further their academic career and educational opportunities.\n\nThe premises are:\n1.

We want to see if the conclusion follows from the premises.\nFrom 4, I -> C, so ~C -> ~I.\nFrom 3, C -> ~S.\nFrom 5, A -> S.\n\nLet's consider the case where (A & C) is true. Then A is true, so S is true (from 5). Since C is true, S is false (from 3). This is a contradiction. Therefore (A & C) cannot be true.\n\nNow, let's consider the case where ~A is true. Then we need to show that S v I is true.\nIf ~A is true, then A is false. If A is false, it does not violate any premises.\nIf ~A is true, it could be that Bonnie is not a student who attends the school.\nIf Bonnie is not a student who attends the school, then from 6, it must be that ~E is true.\nIf ~E is true, then ~P is true (from 1).\nIf ~P is true, then I is true (from 2).\nIf I is true, then C is true (from 4).\nIf C is true, then ~S is true (from 3).\nSo we have ~S and I, which implies S v I is true.\n\nHowever, this is getting too complex. Let's rewrite the conclusion:\n~((A & C) v ~A) -> (S v I)\n~((A & C) v ~A) is equivalent to ~(A & C) & A.\nSo, (~(A & C) & A) -> (S v I).\nThis means that if A is true and C is false, then S v I is true.\nIf A is true, then S is true (from 5). So S v I is true.\nTherefore, the conclusion is true.\n\nANSWER:\tTrue\n", "Let's break this down step-by-step. The conclusion is a conditional statement. We need to analyze the implications of the premises to see if the conclusion necessarily follows.\n\nLet's denote the following:\nP: people perform in school talent shows often\nQ: attend and are very engaged with school events\nR: inactive and disinterested members of their community\nS: chaperone high school dances\nT: students who attend the school\nU: young children and teenagers who wish to further their academic careers and educational opportunities\n\nThe premises can be rewritten as:\n1.

This means U is true and S is true. Since U is true, U -> T means T is true. Also, S is true, so R must be true (since R -> S). Since T is true, the conclusion T v R is true.\n\nCase 2: ~U is true. Then the implication (U & S) v ~U -> (T v R) is true regardless of the value of (T v R).\n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion more carefully. We have (U & S) v ~U -> (T v R). This is equivalent to ~( (U & S) v ~U) v (T v R) which is equivalent to ~(U & S) & U v (T v R). This is equivalent to (~U v ~S) & U v (T v R).\n\nLet's try to find a counterexample. Suppose Bonnie is a young child who wishes to further her academic career (U is true), and she chaperones high school dances (S is true). Then U & S is true. From premise 5, U -> T, so T is true. From premise 3, S -> ~T, so ~T is true. This is a contradiction, so it is impossible for both U and S to be true.\n\nSince it is impossible for both U and S to be true, the premise (U & S) v ~U is always true.\nIf U is true, S must be false, as otherwise we have a contradiction. Then (U & S) v ~U is equivalent to ~U v ~S.\nWe want to see if (T v R) is true.\n\nLet's assume Bonnie is a young child who wishes to further her academic career (U is true). Then she is a student (T is true).\nIf Bonnie chaperones high school dances (S is true), then she is not a student (from premise 3). This contradicts the fact that she is a student.\nSo, if U is true, then S must be false.\nIf S is false, then R is false.\nSo, we have T is true and R is false. Thus, T v R is true.\n\nIf U is false, then T is false. Since R -> S, ~S -> ~R.

We want to evaluate if Inception is a folk song. We know that Inception is a sci-fi movie. Since all movies are videos and Inception is a movie, it is a video, which means it is visual. On the other hand, we know that all folk songs are songs, and no songs are visual, so no folk songs are visual. Therefore, since Inception is visual but no folk songs are visual, we know that Inception cannot be a folk song, so the statement is false.\nANSWER:\tFalse\n</EVALUATE>\n\n---\n<PREMISES>\nEvery chef can cook.\nSome people who aren\u2019t chefs can cook.\nPeople who cook can make scrambled eggs and pasta.\nIf someone can make cookies and muffins, they are a baker.\nBakers who can also make scrambled eggs can make a good breakfast.\nLuke can make cookies, scrambled eggs, and muffins, but not pasta.\n</PREMISES>\n<CONCLUSION>\nLuke can make a good breakfast.\n</CONCLUSION>\n<EVALUATE>\n\nLet's think step by step.

From Premises 2 and 4, we can deduce that Talent Show OR Chaperone.\nFrom Premises 1 and 2, if someone is not inactive, then they perform in school talent shows often and attend and are very engaged with school events.\n\nNow let's look at the conclusion.\nAssume Bonnie chaperones high school dances. From Premise 3, Bonnie is not a student. From Premise 5, Bonnie does not wish to further her academic career. From Premise 4, Bonnie is inactive.

Thus, in this case, James has lunch in the company.\n\nCase 2: James is neither a manager nor appears in the company today.\nSince James appears in the company if he schedules a meeting with customers (premise 1), and James does not appear in the company, he did not schedule a meeting with customers. Since everyone who has lunch in the company schedules meetings with customers (premise 2), James does not have lunch in the company. Thus, in this case, James does not have lunch in the company.\n\nSince the conclusion is not true in Case 1, the conclusion is uncertain.\nANSWER:\tUncertain\n", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if James does not have lunch in the company.\nWe are given that James is either a manager and appears in the company today or neither a manager nor appears in the company today.\nCase 1: James is a manager and appears in the company today.\nSince James appears in the company today, from premise 1, he must have scheduled a meeting with his customers.\nFrom premise 2, anyone who schedules meetings with their customers has lunch in the company.\nTherefore, James has lunch in the company.\nCase 2: James is neither a manager nor appears in the company today.\nSince James does not appear in the company today, from premise 1, he did not schedule a meeting with his customers.\nFrom premise 2, if James did not schedule a meeting with his customers, he does not have lunch in the company.\nTherefore, James does not have lunch in the company.\nHowever, we know that managers do not work remotely from home, so they must appear in the company today.\nIf James is a manager, he appears in the company today, and has lunch in the company.\nIf James is not a manager, he does not appear in the company today, and does not have lunch in the company.\nFrom premise 7, James is either a manager and appears in the company today or neither a manager nor appears in the company today.\nIf James is a manager and appears in the company today, he has lunch in the company.\nIf James is not a manager and does not appear in the company today, he does not have lunch in the company.\nSo, the conclusion is not always true. Thus, the statement is uncertain.\n\nHowever, let's consider the second case again. James is neither a manager nor appears in the company today. Then he didn't schedule a meeting. Since he didn't schedule a meeting, he doesn't have lunch in the company.\nSo it seems like the conclusion is true.\n\nLet's rewrite premise 7: James is a manager -> James appears in the company.\nAnd also, James is not a manager -> James does not appear in the company.\n\nFrom premise 1: If James schedules a meeting, James appears in the company.\nFrom premise 2: If James has lunch in the company, James schedules a meeting.\nThus, James has lunch in the company -> James appears in the company.\nFrom premise 3: James has lunch in the company or James has lunch at home.\nFrom premise 4: If James has lunch at home, James works remotely from home.\nFrom premise 5: If James works remotely from home, James is in other countries.\nFrom premise 6: Managers do not work remotely from home.\nIf James is a manager, then James does not work remotely from home.\n\nIf James is a manager, then James appears in the company.\nThen James has lunch in the company.\nIf James is not a manager, then James does not appear in the company.\nThen James does not have lunch in the company.\nSo, if James is a manager, James has lunch in the company.\nIf James is not a manager, James does not have lunch in the company.\nTherefore, the conclusion is true.\n\nANSWER:\tTrue\n", "Let's think step by step.

Let's consider the two cases from premise 7: 1) James is a manager and appears in the company today, or 2) James is neither a manager nor appears in the company today.\nCase 1: James is a manager and appears in the company today. Since no managers work remotely from home, James does not work remotely from home. If James has lunch in the company, then James schedules meetings with customers, so James appears in the company today, which is consistent with this case.\nCase 2: James is neither a manager nor appears in the company today. If James appears in the company today, then James schedules meetings with customers. But since James does not appear in the company today, James does not schedule meetings with customers. Then James does not have lunch in the company, since everyone who has lunch in the company schedules meetings with customers.\nIf James does not appear in the company, then James does not schedule meetings with customers, and James does not have lunch in the company. If James has lunch at home, then James works remotely from home. So, it seems like James might have lunch at home.\n\nSuppose James is a manager and appears in the company today. Then James schedules meetings with his customers, and has lunch in the company.\nSuppose James is not a manager and does not appear in the company today. Then James does not schedule meetings with his customers, and does not have lunch in the company.\nTherefore, it is not always the case that James does not have lunch in the company. Therefore, it is uncertain.\n\nLet's try to prove the conclusion. Suppose James has lunch in the company. Then James schedules meetings with customers and appears in the company today. Since James appears in the company today, James is a manager. But James cannot be a manager and not a manager. Therefore, James cannot have lunch in the company.

Therefore, the conclusion is true.\n\nANSWER: True\n", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate the statement \"If James is either a manager or in other countries,  then James either has lunch at home and works remotely from home, or neither has lunch at home nor works remotely from home\".\n\nLet's assume James is a manager. Then, from premise 7, James appears in the company today. From premise 1, since James appears in the company today, James scheduled a meeting with customers. From premise 2, since James scheduled a meeting with customers, James has lunch in the company. From premise 3, James does not have lunch at home. From premise 4, James does not work remotely from home. So, James does not have lunch at home and James does not work remotely from home.\n\nLet's assume James is in other countries. Then, from premise 5, James works remotely from home. From premise 4, James has lunch at home. So, James has lunch at home and James works remotely from home.\n\nTherefore, in either case, James either has lunch at home and works remotely from home, or neither has lunch at home nor works remotely from home.\nANSWER: True\n", "Let's think step by step.

Thus, the conclusion is true.\nANSWER: True\n", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate the statement \"If James is either a manager or in other countries,  then James either has lunch at home and works remotely from home, or neither has lunch at home nor works remotely from home.\"\nLet's consider two cases:\nCase 1: James is a manager. From premise 7, James appears in the company today. From premise 6, managers do not work remotely from home, therefore James doesn't have lunch at home. Therefore, James doesn't have lunch at home and doesn't work remotely from home.\nCase 2: James is in other countries. From premise 5, James works remotely from home, so James has lunch at home. Therefore, James has lunch at home and works remotely from home.\nIn both cases, the conclusion holds.\nTherefore, the statement is true.\nANSWER: True\n", "Let's think step by step.\nLet $A$ be \"James is a manager\".\nLet $B$ be \"James appears in the company today\".\nLet $C$ be \"James has lunch in the company\".\nLet $D$ be \"James has lunch at home\".\nLet $E$ be \"James works remotely from home\".\nLet $F$ be \"James is in other countries\".\n\nThe premises are:\n1. $C \\to B$\n2. $C \\to C$ (Trivially true)\n3. $C \\lor D$\n4. $D \\to E$\n5. $F \\to E$\n6. $\\neg (A \\land E)$\n7. $(A \\land B) \\lor (\\neg A \\land \\neg B)$\n\nThe conclusion is: $(A \\lor F) \\to ((D \\land E) \\lor (\\neg D \\land \\neg E))$.\n\nLet's analyze the conclusion. We assume $A \\lor F$ is true. We want to show that $(D \\land E) \\lor (\\neg D \\land \\neg E)$ is true.\n\nIf $A$ is true, then by (7), $B$ is true. Since $B$ is true, $C$ is true (by 1). Since $C$ is true, $C \\lor D$ is true, but $C$ is true, so $D$ is false. Thus, $D \\to E$ implies that $E$ is false. Therefore, $\\neg D$ is true and $\\neg E$ is true. This means $(\\neg D \\land \\neg E)$ is true, so $(D \\land E) \\lor (\\neg D \\land \\neg E)$ is true.\n\nIf $F$ is true, then $E$ is true (by 5). Since $D \\to E$, we have $D$ is true or $E$ is true. Since $E$ is true, $D$ could be true or false. If $D$ is true, then $D \\land E$ is true. If $D$ is false, then $\\neg D$ is true and $\\neg E$ is false. So $D \\land E$ or $\\neg D \\land \\neg E$ is true.\nIf $F$ is true, then $E$ is true. $C \\lor D$ is true. $D \\to E$.\nIf $D$ is true, then $E$ is true. $D \\land E$ is true.\nIf $D$ is false, then $C$ is true. So $C \\to B$ is true.\n\nConsider the case where James is a manager. Then James appears in the company today. James schedules meetings with customers and appears in the company today. James has lunch in the company. James does not have lunch at home. James does not work remotely from home.\nSince James is a manager, James cannot work remotely from home. Thus, he does not have lunch at home.\n\nIf James is in other countries, then James works remotely from home.\nIf James is a manager and in other countries, then he works remotely from home and is a manager, which is a contradiction.\n\nThe conclusion seems to be true.\n\nANSWER: True\n", "Let's think step by step. The conclusion is a conditional statement. Let's assume James is either a manager or in other countries.\nCase 1: James is a manager. From premise 7, James appears in the company today. From premise 1, James scheduled a meeting with their customers. From premise 2, James has lunch in the company. From premise 3, James does not have lunch at home.

We know that KO is a mature company's stock. Since all mature companies\u2019 stocks are suitable for a retirement fund, and if a stock is volatile, it is not suitable for a retirement fund, it follows that KO is not volatile. From premise 3, some companies\u2019 stocks are growth companies\u2019 stocks. Since KO is a mature company\u2019s stock, KO is not a growth company\u2019s stock.

This is equivalent to saying that if KO is a growth company's stock or its price is volatile, then KO is not a growth company's stock and its price is not volatile.\n\nFrom the premises, we know that KO is a mature company's stock (premise 5). Since mature companies' stocks are suitable for retirement funds (premise 4) and growth companies' stocks are volatile (premise 1), and volatile stocks are not suitable for a retirement fund (premise 2), we know that KO is not a growth company's stock. So A is false. Also, KO is suitable for a retirement fund. Since volatile stocks are not suitable for a retirement fund, KO is not volatile. Thus B is false.\n\nSince both A and B are false, A or B is false.

Since KO is suitable for a retirement fund, it must not be volatile. Thus, the second part of P, \"its price is volatile\", is also false.\nSince both parts of P are false, P is false.\n\nIf P is false, then the conditional statement \"If P then Q\" is true regardless of the value of Q.\nThus, the conclusion is true.\n\nHowever, let's analyze the statement more carefully.\nSince KO is a mature company\u2019s stock, it is not a growth company\u2019s stock. Therefore, the first part of the \u201cor\u201d in P is false.\nSince KO is a mature company\u2019s stock, it is suitable for a retirement fund. Therefore, it is not volatile. So the second part of the \u201cor\u201d in P is also false. Thus P is false.\n\nSince P is false, the conditional statement \u201cIf P then Q\u201d is true regardless of the value of Q.\n\nHowever, Q says KO is neither a company\u2019s stock nor its price is volatile. This is false, since KO *is* a company\u2019s stock. Therefore, the statement \"If P then Q\" is false.\n\nSince KO is a mature company\u2019s stock, it is *not* a growth company\u2019s stock. Therefore, the first disjunct of P is false. Also, KO is suitable for a retirement fund, so it is *not* volatile. Therefore, the second disjunct of P is also false. Therefore, P is false.\nSince P is false, the implication \u201cIf P then Q\u201d is true no matter what Q is.\nQ states that KO is neither a company's stock nor volatile. This is false because KO is a company\u2019s stock. Thus, Q is false.\nTherefore, the implication \"If P then Q\" is true because P is false.\n\nLet's re-examine the conclusion. It says \"If KO is a growth company\u2019s stock or if its price is volatile, then KO is neither a company\u2019s stock nor is its price volatile.\"\nSince KO is a mature company stock, it is not a growth company stock. Also, mature stocks are suitable for retirement funds, so KO is not volatile. Thus the left side of the implication is false, so the implication is true.\n\nHowever, the right side is \"KO is neither a company\u2019s stock nor is its price volatile.\" This is false since KO *is* a company\u2019s stock. Since the right side is false, the entire implication is false.\n\nLet's rewrite the conclusion: If (KO is a growth company's stock OR KO is volatile) then (KO is not a company's stock AND KO is not volatile).\n\nSince KO is a mature company's stock, it's not a growth company's stock.\nSince KO is a mature company's stock, it's suitable for a retirement fund, and thus not volatile.\n\nTherefore, the left side of the implication is FALSE.\nThe right side of the implication is FALSE (because KO *is* a company's stock).\n\nTherefore, the implication is TRUE.\n\nANSWER: True\n"], "answers": ["True", "True", "True", "True", "True", "True", "True", "True", "True", "True"], "reference": "True", "time_total": 95.1004650592804, "time_llm": 95.09906959533691, "prompt_length": 8734}

We want to determine if that leads to a contradiction with the premises.\n\nFrom premise 2, if a restaurant has a rating greater than 9, it is listed in Yelp's recommendations, and thus does not receive many negative reviews.

This is a contradiction, since we already said its rating is not greater than 9.\n\nThe premise states \"If Subway provides take-out service and receives many negative reviews, then its rating is greater than 9 and it does not provide take-out service.\" Since we showed that if Subway provides take-out service and receives many negative reviews, then it is impossible for Subway to have a rating greater than 9, this statement is false.\nANSWER: False\n", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate the statement: If Subway provides take-out service and receives many negative reviews, then its rating is greater than 9 and it does not provide take-out service. This is a conditional statement, so let's assume the antecedent is true: Subway provides take-out service and receives many negative reviews.\nFrom premise 3, restaurants that do not provide take-out service receive many negative reviews. This means if Subway receives many negative reviews, it might not provide take-out service. However, we are assuming it provides take-out service. So there is a contradiction.\nLet's look at the premises again. From premise 5, Subway has a rating greater than 9 or is popular among local residents. If its rating is greater than 9, then it is listed in Yelp\u2019s recommendations, and it does not receive many negative reviews (premise 1 and 2). But we are assuming it receives many negative reviews. Therefore, the rating cannot be greater than 9. So, Subway must be popular among local residents. Since it is popular, its rating must be greater than 9 (premise 4). Therefore, it is listed in Yelp\u2019s recommendations, and it does not receive many negative reviews (premise 1 and 2). This contradicts our assumption that Subway receives many negative reviews.\n\nThe antecedent is false. Thus, the conditional statement is true. However, the statement itself is confusing and seems self-contradictory. Let's examine the statement carefully.\n\nThe statement says that if Subway provides take-out service and receives many negative reviews, then its rating is greater than 9 AND it does not provide take-out service. The second part \"it does not provide take-out service\" contradicts the first part of the antecedent \"Subway provides take-out service\". So this conditional statement is false.\n\nHowever, since we assumed the antecedent is true, it leads to a contradiction.\n\nConsider the case where Subway provides take-out service and receives many negative reviews.\nFrom premise 3, restaurants that do not provide take-out receive many negative reviews. Since Subway *does* provide take-out, it shouldn't receive many negative reviews. This is a contradiction.\nThe statement is false.\n\nANSWER: False\n", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate the statement \"If Subway provides take-out service and receives many negative reviews, then its rating is greater than 9 and it does not provide take-out service\". This is a conditional statement of the form (P -> Q), where P is \"Subway provides take-out service and receives many negative reviews\", and Q is \"its rating is greater than 9 and it does not provide take-out service\".\nLet's suppose Subway provides take-out service and receives many negative reviews. From premise 3, restaurants that do not provide take-out service receive many negative reviews. But we have assumed that Subway provides take-out service and receives many negative reviews, which is a contradiction.\nHowever, let's try to determine if the statement is true or false. Suppose Subway provides take-out service and receives many negative reviews. We want to show that it must be that Subway's rating is greater than 9 and it does not provide take-out service. But we have already assumed that Subway provides take-out service, which is a contradiction.\nFrom premise 5, Subway has a rating greater than 9 or is popular among local residents. Let's consider the case where Subway's rating is greater than 9. Then, from premise 2, Subway is listed in Yelp's recommendations, so Subway does not receive many negative reviews. But we assumed Subway receives many negative reviews, which is a contradiction. Therefore, Subway must be popular among local residents. Then, from premise 4, Subway has a rating greater than 9. Again, this leads to a contradiction.\nIf Subway provides take-out service and receives many negative reviews, this implies that it does not provide take-out service, which is a contradiction. So, it is impossible for Subway to provide take-out service and receive many negative reviews. Thus the conditional statement is true.\nHowever, this logic is flawed. Let's try another approach.\n\nLet A = Subway provides take-out service.\nLet B = Subway receives many negative reviews.\nLet C = Subway's rating is greater than 9.\nLet D = Subway does not provide take-out service.\nThe conclusion is (A and B) -> (C and D). This is equivalent to not (A and B) or (C and D).\n\nSuppose Subway provides take-out service (A) and receives many negative reviews (B). From premise 3, restaurants that do not provide take-out service receive many negative reviews. Thus, if Subway receives many negative reviews, it must not provide take-out service, which means D. But we assumed A, so A and D is a contradiction.\nSince A and B is impossible, the conclusion (A and B) -> (C and D) is always true.\nANSWER:\tTrue\n", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if \"If Subway provides take-out service and receives many negative reviews, then its rating is greater than 9 and it does not provide take-out service.\" This is a conditional statement. Let's assume the antecedent (Subway provides take-out service and receives many negative reviews) is true. We want to see if the consequent (its rating is greater than 9 and it does not provide take-out service) must also be true.\n\nIf Subway receives many negative reviews, then it is not listed in Yelp's recommendations (premise 1).\nIf Subway's rating is greater than 9, then it is listed in Yelp's recommendations (premise 2).\nThus, if Subway receives many negative reviews, its rating cannot be greater than 9.\nSince Subway has a rating greater than 9 or is popular among local residents (premise 5), and if its rating is not greater than 9, then it must be popular among local residents.\nIf Subway is popular among local residents, then its rating is greater than 9 (premise 4).\n\nNow let's analyze the antecedent. If Subway provides take-out service and receives many negative reviews, then its rating is not greater than 9. The consequent says its rating is greater than 9 and it does not provide take-out service. These statements are contradictory. Thus, the entire conditional statement is false.\n\nANSWER: False\n", "Let's think step by step.\nLet's analyze the conclusion: \"If Subway provides take-out service and receives many negative reviews, then its rating is greater than 9 and it does not provide take-out service.\" This is a conditional statement with a complex antecedent and consequent. We need to determine if this statement is necessarily true given the premises.\n\nLet's break down the premises:\n1. Yelp rec -> no negative reviews\n2. rating > 9 -> Yelp rec\n3. no takeout -> many negative reviews\n4. popular -> rating > 9\n5. Subway has rating > 9 OR Subway is popular\n\nAssume Subway provides take-out service and receives many negative reviews. This is the antecedent of the conditional statement.\n\nFrom premise 3, if Subway does not provide take-out, it receives many negative reviews. The contrapositive is: if Subway does not receive many negative reviews, it provides take-out. Since we assumed Subway receives many negative reviews, this doesn't necessarily mean Subway doesn't provide take-out.\n\nFrom premise 2, if Subway's rating is greater than 9, then it is listed in Yelp's recommendations, and thus doesn't receive many negative reviews (premise 1). But we assumed Subway receives many negative reviews. Therefore, Subway's rating cannot be greater than 9.\n\nFrom premise 5, Subway has rating > 9 or is popular. Since we deduced Subway's rating is not greater than 9, it must be popular.\nFrom premise 4, if Subway is popular, its rating > 9. But this contradicts our previous deduction that Subway's rating is not greater than 9.\n\nThe premises lead to a contradiction. Therefore, the antecedent of the conclusion cannot be true, meaning the conclusion itself must be true (vacuously). However, this is not a strong argument. Let's try to find a counterexample.\n\nSuppose Subway provides take-out and receives many negative reviews. Then, from premise 3, we can't conclude anything about whether it provides take-out. From premise 5, Subway must be popular. From premise 4, Subway's rating > 9. But from premise 1 and 2, Subway does not receive many negative reviews. This contradicts the assumption. Therefore, it is impossible for Subway to provide take-out and receive many negative reviews.\n\nThe consequent is \"its rating is greater than 9 and it does not provide take-out service\". Since the antecedent is false, the entire conditional statement is true.\n\nHowever, the consequent is \"rating > 9 and no takeout\", but the antecedent is \"takeout and many negative reviews\".\nIf we assume takeout and many negative reviews, then by premise 3, no takeout -> many negative reviews, so it's possible to have takeout and many negative reviews.\nIf we assume rating > 9, then by premise 1, no negative reviews. But we assumed many negative reviews, so rating cannot be > 9.\nIf we assume Subway is popular, then rating > 9. But we already know rating cannot be > 9.\nSo Subway is popular. Since Subway is popular, rating > 9. But we also have many negative reviews. This is a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, the antecedent is false, and the conditional statement is true.\n\nANSWER:\tTrue\n"], "answers": ["False", "False", "False", "False", "False", "False", "False", "True", "False", "True"], "reference": "Uncertain", "time_total": 110.24183440208435, "time_llm": 110.24037313461304, "prompt_length": 8922}

(H is E and H is U)\nFrom 3, if Harry is evil, then Harry is ugly. This is consistent.\nFrom 1, if Harry is evil, then Harry is not kind.\nSince Harry is a CEO, he is a gentleman, which means he is handsome. But since he is ugly, this is a contradiction. So this case cannot happen.\n\nCase 2: Harry is neither evil nor ugly. (H is ~E and H is ~U)\nFrom 3, if Harry is evil, then Harry is ugly. Since Harry is not evil, this doesn't tell us anything about whether he is ugly.\nFrom 1, if Harry is not evil, then Harry is kind.\nHarry is a CEO, and hence a gentleman, and hence handsome. But Harry is not ugly, which is consistent with being handsome.\n\nNow, let's look at the \"then\" part: Harry is neither kind nor a CEO.\nIf Harry is neither kind nor a CEO, then he is not kind and he is not a CEO.

Since Harry is a gentleman (premise 6), he is handsome (premise 4). But, all evil people are ugly (premise 3). If Harry is evil, he is ugly. However, being handsome and ugly is a contradiction. Therefore, Harry cannot be both evil and ugly.\n\nNow consider the second part of the \"if\" condition: Harry is neither evil nor ugly. Since Harry is a gentleman, he is handsome. Since Harry is a gentleman, he is also a CEO (premise 5). Since a man is either kind or evil (premise 1), and Harry is not evil, then Harry is kind. So Harry is kind and is a CEO.\n\nSo the \"if\" condition is false. Since the antecedent is false, the entire conditional statement is true.\n\nHowever, let's try a more formal approach.

However, in this case, we are told that he does not develop strong bonds with his family, which from premise 4, means that he does not live at home regularly.\nTherefore, in both cases, it is possible that Luke spends a lot of time hanging out with his siblings.\nHowever, premise 5 says that Hangout with siblings -> Not live at home. If Luke is a twin or triplet and develops strong bonds, this contradicts premise 4, which says Not live at home -> Not strong bonds.\nWe have (Twin/Triplet AND Strong Bonds). From premise 1, Luke hangs out with siblings. From premise 5, Luke did not live at home. From premise 4, Luke does not have strong bonds. This is a contradiction. Therefore, we must have (Not Twin/Triplet AND Not Strong Bonds).\nSince Luke is not a twin or triplet, and he does not develop strong bonds, we cannot conclude anything about whether he spends a lot of time hanging out with his siblings.\nTherefore, the conclusion is uncertain.\n\nHowever, from premise 6, we have (Twin/Triplet AND Strong Bonds) OR (Not Twin/Triplet AND Not Strong Bonds). Let's consider the first case.\nIf Luke is a twin/triplet AND develops strong bonds with his family members, then by premise 1, he spends a lot of time hanging out with his siblings.\nIf Luke is not a twin/triplet AND does not develop strong bonds with his family members, then we can't say anything.\nWe want to evaluate the statement \"Luke spends a lot of time hanging out and playing with his siblings.\"\n\nIf Luke is a twin/triplet and develops strong bonds, then Luke spends a lot of time hanging out with his siblings.\nIf Luke is not a twin/triplet and does not develop strong bonds, then we cannot say anything about whether he spends time hanging out with his siblings.\nSince the premise states that either the first case or the second case is true, we can't say that Luke necessarily spends a lot of time hanging out with his siblings.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{Uncertain}$\n", "Let's think step by step.

From (5), Luke did not live at home regularly. From (4), this contradicts developing strong family bonds. So, this case is impossible.\n\nCase 2: Luke is not a twin/triplet and does not develop strong bonds.\nSince Luke does not develop strong bonds, from (4), Luke does not live at home regularly.\nFrom (5), Luke hangs out with siblings.\nFrom (1), Luke is a twin or triplet. This contradicts our assumption. So, this case is impossible.\n\nThe premises lead to a contradiction. However, we need to evaluate the conclusion.\n\nLet's consider the premises again. From premise 6, we know that either Luke is a twin/triplet and develops strong bonds with his family members, or he is not a twin/triplet and doesn't develop strong bonds.\nAssume Luke is a twin or triplet and develops strong bonds.

But this contradicts the fact that he develops strong bonds (premise 4).\nAssume Luke is not a twin or triplet and doesn't develop strong bonds. Then he did live at home regularly (premise 4). Since he is not a twin or triplet, he doesn't have siblings who are the same age.

We cannot conclude this from the premises.\n\nLet's consider the case where Luke is a twin or triplet.\nThen he spends a lot of time with his siblings. He did not live at home regularly.

Since he is not a twin or triplet, his siblings are not the same age. Thus, he does not complain about annoying siblings.\n\nSince premise 6 states that either (twin/triplet & strong bonds) or (not twin/triplet & no strong bonds), we can analyze the implications.\nIf twin/triplet and strong bonds, then hang out with siblings, then didn't live at home. But strong bonds imply living at home, so this is a contradiction.\nIf not twin/triplet and no strong bonds, then live at home, so siblings are not the same age, so no complaints.\n\nSince there is a contradiction, the premises cannot all be true.\nHowever, we are asked to evaluate the conclusion given the premises.

From premise 5, if he spends a lot of time hanging out with and playing with his siblings, then he often did not live at home regularly. From premise 4, if he did not live at home regularly, then he does not develop strong bonds with his family members. However, this contradicts the assumption that Luke develops strong bonds with his family members.

This contradicts the assumption that he develops strong bonds with his family members, so this case is impossible.\nCase 2: Luke is neither a twin or triplet nor develops strong bonds with his family members.\nIn this case, we cannot deduce whether Luke complains often about annoying siblings.\n\nLet's try to use contrapositives.\nPremise 3: If people complain often about annoying siblings, then they have siblings who are the same age.\nContrapositive: If people do not have siblings who are the same age, then they do not complain often about annoying siblings.\nPremise 2: If people have siblings who are the same age, then they are twins or triplets.\nContrapositive: If people are not twins or triplets, then they do not have siblings who are the same age.\nCombining these two contrapositives, if people are not twins or triplets, then they do not complain often about annoying siblings.\nFrom premise 6, Luke is either both a twin or triplet and develops strong bonds with his family members, or he neither is a twin or triplet nor develops strong bonds with his family members.\nIf Luke is not a twin or triplet, then Luke does not complain often about annoying siblings.\nIf Luke is a twin or triplet, we have a contradiction, so Luke is not a twin or triplet.\nTherefore, Luke does not complain often about annoying siblings.\n\nHowever, we can also consider the following:\nIf Luke is a twin or triplet, then he spends a lot of time with his siblings (Premise 1).\nIf he spends a lot of time with his siblings, he often did not live at home regularly (Premise 5).\nIf he did not live at home regularly, he does not develop strong bonds with his family (Premise 4).\nBut we are told he develops strong bonds with his family, so he cannot be a twin or triplet.\nThus, Luke is neither a twin or triplet, and he does not develop strong bonds with his family.\nIf Luke has siblings who are the same age, then he is a twin or triplet (Premise 2). Since Luke is not a twin or triplet, he does not have siblings who are the same age.\nIf Luke does not have siblings who are the same age, then he does not complain often about annoying siblings (contrapositive of Premise 3).\nThus, Luke does not complain often about annoying siblings.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is false.\n\nANSWER: False\n", "Let's think step by step.

Therefore, in La Liga 2021-2022, Real Madrid received more points than Barcelona, so Real Madrid ranks higher than Barcelona, so the statement is true.\nANSWER:\tTrue\n</EVALUATE>\n\n---\n<PREMISES>\nAll athletes are good at sports.\nAll Olympic gold medal winners are good athletes.\nNo scientists are good at sports.\nAll Nobel laureates are scientists.\nAmy is good at sports or Amy is an Olympic gold medal winner.\nIf Amy is not a Nobel laureate, then Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner.\n</PREMISES>\n<CONCLUSION>\nIf Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner, then Amy is a Nobel laureate.\n</CONCLUSION>\n<EVALUATE>\n\nLet's think step by step. We want to evaluate the statement \"if Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner, then Amy is a Nobel laureate\". Let's assume that Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner. This doesn't tell us anything about whether Amy is a Nobel laureate, so the statement isn't true, meaning it is either False or Uncertain. To distinguish between the two, notice that we could have a scenario where Amy is neither an Olympic gold medal winner nor a Nobel laureate. None of the premises are violated in this case.

We want to evaluate if James contributes to the country. Let's think about what we know about James. First, we know that James was either sentenced for thief or stayed in prison. However, this doesn't tell us anything about whether James contributed to the country. Second, we know that James either had a bad record in the local state or that he was respected by others. However, the premises don't tell us anything about the relationship between having a bad record and contributing to the country.

We want to evaluate if Inception is a folk song. We know that Inception is a sci-fi movie. Since all movies are videos and Inception is a movie, it is a video, which means it is visual. On the other hand, we know that all folk songs are songs, and no songs are visual, so no folk songs are visual. Therefore, since Inception is visual but no folk songs are visual, we know that Inception cannot be a folk song, so the statement is false.\nANSWER:\tFalse\n</EVALUATE>\n\n---\n<PREMISES>\nEvery chef can cook.\nSome people who aren\u2019t chefs can cook.\nPeople who cook can make scrambled eggs and pasta.\nIf someone can make cookies and muffins, they are a baker.\nBakers who can also make scrambled eggs can make a good breakfast.\nLuke can make cookies, scrambled eggs, and muffins, but not pasta.\n</PREMISES>\n<CONCLUSION>\nLuke can make a good breakfast.\n</CONCLUSION>\n<EVALUATE>\n\nLet's think step by step.

Then, from premise 2, Peter spills a lot of food on his clothing. From premise 6, Peter is either (Spills & Only Child) or (Not Spills & Not Only Child). Since we assume Peter is a foodie, we know he spills, so Peter is either (Spills & Only Child) or (Spills & Not Only Child). From premise 5 and 4, High Net Income -> Busy Parents -> Only Child. So, if Peter has a high net income, he is an only child.\n\nLet's analyze the conclusion: (Foodie & High Net Income) or (Foodie & Not High Net Income).\n\nIf Peter is a foodie, he spills (Premise 2). From Premise 6, he is either (Spills & Only Child) or (Spills & Not Only Child).\nIf Peter is (Spills & Only Child), then by Premise 4, his parents are busy. By Premise 5, his household has high net income. Therefore, (Foodie & High Net Income).\nIf Peter is (Spills & Not Only Child), then his parents are not busy. By Premise 5, his household does not have high net income. Therefore, (Foodie & Not High Net Income).\nSince Peter is either (Spills & Only Child) or (Spills & Not Only Child), the conclusion is always true.\n\nANSWER: True\n", "Let's analyze the premises and the conclusion step by step.\n\nWe are given that Peter is either both a person who spills a lot of food on his clothing and grew up as an only child with no siblings, or he is neither.\n\nCase 1: Peter spills a lot of food and grew up as an only child.\nSince Peter spills a lot of food, he does not tidy his spaces consistently and enjoys cleaning. Also, since Peter grew up as an only child, he tidies his spaces consistently and enjoys cleaning. This is a contradiction.\n\nCase 2: Peter does not spill a lot of food and did not grow up as an only child.\nSince Peter does not spill a lot of food, we cannot conclude anything directly about his tidiness or cleaning habits. Since Peter did not grow up as an only child, we cannot conclude anything about his tidiness or cleaning habits.\n\nNow, consider the premises related to foodies and high net income.\nFoodies who go out frequently spill food.\nPeople with busy parents grew up as only children.\nHouseholds with high net income have busy parents.\n\nIf Peter is a foodie who goes out frequently, then he spills food. But we have established that either he spills food and grew up as an only child (contradiction) or he doesn't spill food and didn't grow up as an only child.\nSo, if Peter is a foodie who goes out frequently, he must have grown up as an only child, which is a contradiction. Therefore, Peter cannot be a foodie who goes out frequently.\n\nNow consider the conclusion:\nPeter is either a foodie who goes out frequently and belongs to a household with a high net income or he is a foodie who goes out frequently nor belongs to a household with a high net income.\n\nSince we determined Peter cannot be a foodie who goes out frequently, the conclusion is False.\n\nANSWER: False\n", "Let's think step by step.

The premise 6 states that Peter is either both a person who spills a lot of food on his clothing and grew up as an only child with no siblings, or he is neither a person who spills a lot of food on his clothing nor grew up as an only child with no siblings.\n\nLet's analyze the two scenarios from premise 6.\n\nCase 1: Peter spills a lot of food and grew up as an only child.\nIf Peter spills a lot of food, then by premise 2, Peter is a foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try.\nIf Peter grew up as an only child, then by premise 4, his parents are very busy with their regular jobs.\nIf Peter's parents are very busy with their regular jobs, then by premise 5, Peter belongs to a household with a high net income.\nThus, in this case, Peter is a foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try and belongs to a household with a high net income.\n\nCase 2: Peter does not spill a lot of food and did not grow up as an only child.\nIf Peter does not spill a lot of food, then he is not a foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try.\nIf Peter did not grow up as an only child, then his parents are not very busy with their regular jobs.\nIf Peter's parents are not very busy with their regular jobs, then Peter does not belong to a household with a high net income.\nThus, in this case, Peter is not a foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try and does not belong to a household with a high net income.\n\nThe conclusion is: Peter is either a foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try and belong to a household with a high net income or he is a foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try nor belongs to a household with a high net income.\n\nBased on the cases we analyzed, the conclusion should be: Peter is either a foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try and belongs to a household with a high net income or he is not a foodie who goes out frequently to find new food restaurants to try and does not belong to a household with a high net income.\n\nThe given conclusion is incorrect.

From premise 6, Peter is either both a person who spills a lot of food on his clothing and grew up as an only child with no siblings, or he is neither a person who spills a lot of food on his clothing nor grew up as an only child with no siblings.\n\nCase 1: Peter spills a lot of food on his clothing and grew up as an only child with no siblings.\nSince Peter spills a lot of food on his clothing, he does not tidy his spaces consistently and enjoy the process of cleaning. Since Peter grew up as an only child with no siblings, he does tidy his spaces consistently and enjoy the process of cleaning. This is a contradiction. Therefore, this case is impossible.\n\nCase 2: Peter is neither a person who spills a lot of food on his clothing nor grew up as an only child with no siblings.\nSince Peter does not spill a lot of food on his clothing, he is not a foodie. Therefore, F is false.\nSince Peter is not a foodie, the conclusion (F and H) or (F and not H) is false, since F is false.\n\nHowever, the question asks whether the conclusion *follows* from the premises. In the analysis above, we found a contradiction in the first case. This means that the only possible case is the second case, which results in the conclusion being false. Therefore, the conclusion does not follow from the premises.\n\nHowever, we need to re-examine the premises. From premise 6, we have two possibilities for Peter:\n1.

If he doesn't spill food, he isn't an only child and his parents aren't busy, and he isn't from a high net income household.\nThe conclusion states that Peter is either a foodie with a high net income *or* a foodie without a high net income. But we only know if he spills food, he is a foodie.\n\nFrom the premises, we can say that *if* Peter spills food, then he is a foodie who comes from a household with high income.

So, if John has a wedding in July, then John must not have at least one child.\nIf John travels to Paris for his honeymoon, then from premise 2, John has a wedding. But from premise 5, if John has at least one child, then John does not travel to Paris for his honeymoon and does not have a wedding.

By premise 6, John has a wedding in July or John travels to Paris for his honeymoon.\nIf John has a wedding in July, then by premise 3, John travels to Paris for his honeymoon. Since John travels to Paris for his honeymoon, and John has a wedding, premise 5 states that John does not have at least one child. This is consistent.\nIf John travels to Paris for his honeymoon, then by premise 2, John has a wedding. Since John travels to Paris for his honeymoon, and John has a wedding, premise 5 states that John does not have at least one child. This is consistent.\n\nNow, suppose John does not have a wedding. Then by premise 1, John does not have at least one child.\n\nSuppose John has a wedding that is not well-attended. Then premise 6 doesn't apply.\n\nConsider the contrapositive of premise 5: If John travels to Paris for his honeymoon or has a wedding, then John does not have at least one child.\nIf John has a wedding in July, then John travels to Paris for his honeymoon (premise 3).

In this case ~Comp and ~C are both true.\nBut, George likes music, so wants to compose, but doesn't have access to a program.

Since Breaking Bad is the Bachelor, it portrays the lives of real people and is a reality TV show. However, we know that Breaking Bad is not a reality TV show, so we reach a contradiction.

We are trying to determine if A implies B.\n\nFrom premise 4, Cholangiocarcinoma is bile duct cancer. Thus, if colorectal cancer is a Cholangiocarcinoma, it is also a bile duct cancer. Therefore, A is equivalent to \"colorectal cancer is a bile duct cancer\".\n\nNow, let's consider premise 6. If colorectal cancer is a bile duct cancer and the survival rate is low, then colorectal cancer is not a bile duct cancer. This is a contradiction. Thus, if colorectal cancer is a bile duct cancer, then either the survival rate is not low or colorectal cancer is not a bile duct cancer.\n\nWe also know that severe cancers are deadly diseases, and deadly diseases have low survival rates. Bile duct cancer is a severe cancer, so it's a deadly disease and has a low survival rate.\n\nThe conclusion states that if colorectal cancer is a bile duct cancer, then it's a bile duct cancer and has mild flu. However, we know that if colorectal cancer is a bile duct cancer, then it has a low survival rate. Also, no one with mild flu has a low survival rate. Therefore, colorectal cancer cannot have both a low survival rate and mild flu.\n\nThe conclusion is false because it implies that colorectal cancer can be both a bile duct cancer and have mild flu, which contradicts the premises.\nANSWER: False\n", "Let's think step by step.

From premise 7, we know that either Taylor grew up in a health-conscious childhood home and she has a good relationship with her parents, or Taylor neither grew up in a health-conscious childhood home nor has a good relationship with her parents. Let's consider the first case. If Taylor grew up in a health-conscious childhood home, then she eats salads regularly. However, if Taylor has a good relationship with her parents, then she does not eat salads regularly. This is a contradiction, so Taylor must not have a good relationship with her parents. From premise 5, if Taylor has a good relationship with her parents, then she does not eat salads regularly. Therefore, since Taylor does not have a good relationship with her parents, it does not tell us anything about whether she eats salads regularly. From premise 6, if Taylor visits the gym at least once a day, then she always fulfills her daily nutritional intakes.\nLet's consider the second case. If Taylor neither grew up in a health-conscious childhood home nor has a good relationship with her parents.

We want to evaluate if Taylor neither grew up in a health-conscious childhood home nor does she visit the gym at least once a day. From premise 7, we know that either (Taylor grew up in a health-conscious childhood home and she has a good relationship with her parents) or (Taylor neither grew up in a health-conscious childhood home nor has a good relationship with her parents).\nLet's assume Taylor grew up in a health-conscious childhood home and she has a good relationship with her parents. Then, from premise 4, Taylor fulfills her nutritional daily intakes. From premise 3, Taylor grew up in a health-conscious childhood home, and so she eats salads regularly. From premise 1, Taylor is conscious about her health and eating habits. From premise 5, since Taylor has a good relationship with her parents, she does not eat salads regularly. This is a contradiction.\nTherefore, it must be the case that Taylor neither grew up in a health-conscious childhood home nor has a good relationship with her parents. We don't know whether she visits the gym at least once a day. However, the statement says \"Taylor neither grew up in a health-conscious childhood home nor does she visit the gym at least once a day.\" Since we know Taylor didn't grow up in a health-conscious childhood home, we only need to determine if she visits the gym.\n\nIf Taylor visits the gym at least once a day, then from premise 6, she fulfills her nutritional daily intakes. From premise 3, if Taylor fulfills her nutritional daily intakes, she grew up in a health-conscious childhood home. But we know that Taylor did not grow up in a health-conscious childhood home.

We want to evaluate if a worksheet is not dispensable. From premise 6, we know that a worksheet is either paper or is environment-friendly. If it is paper, then from premise 3, a worksheet is woodware, and from premise 2, a worksheet is dispensable. If it is environment-friendly, we know it is good from premise 5, but we know nothing about whether it is dispensable.

We want to evaluate if in La Liga 2021-2022, Real Madrid ranks higher than Barcelona. From premise 1, we know that a La Liga soccer team ranks higher than another if it receives more points. From premise 4, we know that in La Liga 2021-2022, Real Madrid received more points than Barcelona. Therefore, in La Liga 2021-2022, Real Madrid received more points than Barcelona, so Real Madrid ranks higher than Barcelona, so the statement is true.\nANSWER:\tTrue\n</EVALUATE>\n\n---\n<PREMISES>\nAll athletes are good at sports.\nAll Olympic gold medal winners are good athletes.\nNo scientists are good at sports.\nAll Nobel laureates are scientists.\nAmy is good at sports or Amy is an Olympic gold medal winner.\nIf Amy is not a Nobel laureate, then Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner.\n</PREMISES>\n<CONCLUSION>\nIf Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner, then Amy is a Nobel laureate.\n</CONCLUSION>\n<EVALUATE>\n\nLet's think step by step. We want to evaluate the statement \"if Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner, then Amy is a Nobel laureate\". Let's assume that Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner. This doesn't tell us anything about whether Amy is a Nobel laureate, so the statement isn't true, meaning it is either False or Uncertain. To distinguish between the two, notice that we could have a scenario where Amy is neither an Olympic gold medal winner nor a Nobel laureate. None of the premises are violated in this case. This means the statement must be false.\nANSWER:\tFalse\n</EVALUATE>\n\n---\n<PREMISES>\nAll people who are respected by others are people who contribute to the country.\nIf a person is respected by others, then he/she contributes to the country.\nAll people available to have a visit without any fees are those respected by others.\nAll Customers who once served in the army are available to have a visit without any fees.\nAll people who once were sentenced for thief stayed in prison for some time.\nAll people who once stayed in prison for some time have a bad record in the local state.\nJames was either once sentenced for thief or stayed in prison for some time.\nJames is either with a bad record in the local state or respected by others.\n</PREMISES>\n<CONCLUSION>\nJames contributes to the country.\n</CONCLUSION>\n<EVALUATE>\n\nLet's think step by step. We want to evaluate if James contributes to the country. Let's think about what we know about James. First, we know that James was either sentenced for thief or stayed in prison. However, this doesn't tell us anything about whether James contributed to the country. Second, we know that James either had a bad record in the local state or that he was respected by others. However, the premises don't tell us anything about the relationship between having a bad record and contributing to the country. Therefore, it is uncertain whether James contributes to the country.\nANSWER:\tUncertain\n</EVALUATE>\n\n---\n<PREMISES>\nNo songs are visual.\nAll folk songs are songs.\nAll videos are visual.\nAll movies are videos.\nAll sci-fi movies are movies.\nInception is a sci-fi movie.\nMac is neither a folk song nor a sci-fi movie.\n</PREMISES>\n<CONCLUSION>\nInception is a folk song.\n</CONCLUSION>\n<EVALUATE>\n\nLet's think step by step. We want to evaluate if Inception is a folk song. We know that Inception is a sci-fi movie. Since all movies are videos and Inception is a movie, it is a video, which means it is visual. On the other hand, we know that all folk songs are songs, and no songs are visual, so no folk songs are visual. Therefore, since Inception is visual but no folk songs are visual, we know that Inception cannot be a folk song, so the statement is false.\nANSWER:\tFalse\n</EVALUATE>\n\n---\n<PREMISES>\nEvery chef can cook.\nSome people who aren\u2019t chefs can cook.\nPeople who cook can make scrambled eggs and pasta.\nIf someone can make cookies and muffins, they are a baker.\nBakers who can also make scrambled eggs can make a good breakfast.\nLuke can make cookies, scrambled eggs, and muffins, but not pasta.\n</PREMISES>\n<CONCLUSION>\nLuke can make a good breakfast.\n</CONCLUSION>\n<EVALUATE>\n\nLet's think step by step. We want to evaluate if Luke can make a good breakfast. From the last premise, we know that Luke can make cookies, scrambled eggs, and muffins. Since Luke can make cookies and muffins, they are a baker. Now, combining the information we have, since Luke is a baker and can make scrambled eggs, this means that they can make a good breakfast. Therefore, Luke can make a good breakfast, so the statement is true.\nANSWER:\tTrue\n</EVALUATE>\n\n---\n<PREMISES>\nETS develops various standardized tests primarily in the United States for K-12 and higher education.\nETS administers international tests including the TOEFL, TOEIC, GRE and subject tests in more than 180 countries.\nMany of the assessments ETS develops are associated with entry to the US tertiary and quaternary education institutions.\nETS also develops K-12 statewide assessments used for accountability testing in many states.\n</PREMISES>\n<CONCLUSION>\nETS develops assessments for K-12 statewide as well as entry to US tertiary and quaternary education institutions.\n</CONCLUSION>\n<EVALUATE>\n\nLet's think step by step.

We want to evaluate if there is a person from BRICS speaking Hindi. We know that there is an Indian, and since India is one of BRICS, we know that there is an Indian in BRICS. Furthermore, we know that they speak either Hindi or English, however, we don't know which one. Therefore, there could be a person in BRICS speaking Hindi, or there could not. Therefore, it is uncertain whether there is a person from BRICS speaking Hindi.\nANSWER:\tUncertain\n</EVALUATE>\n\n\n\n<PREMISES>\nAilton Silva, born in 1995, is commonly known as Ailton.\nAilton is a football player who was loaned out to Braga.\nAilton Silva is a Brazillian footballer who plays for Nautico.\nNautico is a football club along with Braga.\nFluminense is a football club.\n</PREMISES>\n<CONCLUSION>\nAilton Silva was loaned out to a football club.\n</CONCLUSION>\n<EVALUATE>\n", "raw_generations": ["Let's think step by step.
