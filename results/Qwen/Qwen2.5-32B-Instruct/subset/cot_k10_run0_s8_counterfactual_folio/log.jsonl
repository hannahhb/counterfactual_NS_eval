The second premise tells us that there exist at least some bears in deserts.\n\nSince there are bears in deserts and these bears are not animals, it means that there are bears which are not classified as animals.

However, it is stated that platypuses are not animals and echidnas are not animals, but grebes are not platypuses and also not echidnas. Therefore, grebes eating eggs do not fall into the category of platypuses or echidnas. Additionally, the premises state that birds are plants and animals are birds, which means birds are a subset of animals. Since grebes eat eggs, which only birds eat, and grebes are not platypuses or echidnas, it must be concluded that grebes are birds. This means the conclusion that grebes are not birds is false.\nANSWER: False\n", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if Grebes are not birds. From premise 10, we know that birds are plants. From premise 9, we know that animals are birds. From premise 1, we know that the only types of birds that eat eggs are either platypuses or echidnas. From premise 2 and 3, we know that platypuses and echidnas are not animals, and hence not birds. From premise 8, Grebes eat eggs, and from premise 11, Grebes are not platypuses and also not echidnas.

The statement is true.\nANSWER: True\n", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if Grebes are not birds. The premises are contradictory in several aspects, but let's focus on the relevant information.\n\nFrom the first premise, we know that the only types of birds that eat eggs are either platypuses or echidnas. Grebes eat eggs, but the premises state that Grebes are not platypuses and not echidnas.\n\nFrom the fourth premise, \"No birds are vertebrates,\" and the fifth premise, \"All plants are either vertebrates or vertebrates,\" we know that birds cannot be vertebrates. The sixth premise, \"Birds are plants,\" suggests that birds are plants, but since plants are vertebrates, this creates a contradiction with the statement that birds are not vertebrates.\n\nThe seventh premise, \"Animals are birds,\" suggests that all animals are birds, but the second and third premises state that platypuses and echidnas are not animals, which conflicts with the idea that all animals are birds.\n\nGiven these contradictions, the premises are inconsistent. However, based on the information that grebes eat eggs but are not platypuses or echidnas, and considering the contradictory nature of the premises, it is not possible to conclude definitively whether grebes are birds or not. Therefore, the statement \"Grebes are not birds\" cannot be determined with certainty based on the given premises.\n\nANSWER: Uncertain\n", "Let's think step by step.

However, Premise 9 tells us that Grebes are not platypuses and not echidnas, which creates a contradiction because according to Premise 1, only platypuses or echidnas eat eggs. \n\nGiven this contradiction, we can infer that Grebes cannot be birds because Premise 1 specifies that the only birds that eat eggs are platypuses or echidnas, which Grebes are not.

However, the premises don't tell us anything about the relationship between having a bad record and contributing to the country. Therefore, it is uncertain whether James contributes to the country.\nANSWER:\tUncertain\n</EVALUATE>\n\n---\n<PREMISES>\nNo songs are visual.\nAll folk songs are songs.\nAll videos are visual.\nAll movies are videos.\nAll sci-fi movies are movies.\nInception is a sci-fi movie.\nMac is neither a folk song nor a sci-fi movie.\n</PREMISES>\n<CONCLUSION>\nInception is a folk song.\n</CONCLUSION>\n<EVALUATE>\n\nLet's think step by step. We want to evaluate if Inception is a folk song. We know that Inception is a sci-fi movie. Since all movies are videos and Inception is a movie, it is a video, which means it is visual. On the other hand, we know that all folk songs are songs, and no songs are visual, so no folk songs are visual. Therefore, since Inception is visual but no folk songs are visual, we know that Inception cannot be a folk song, so the statement is false.\nANSWER:\tFalse\n</EVALUATE>\n\n---\n<PREMISES>\nEvery chef can cook.\nSome people who aren\u2019t chefs can cook.\nPeople who cook can make scrambled eggs and pasta.\nIf someone can make cookies and muffins, they are a baker.\nBakers who can also make scrambled eggs can make a good breakfast.\nLuke can make cookies, scrambled eggs, and muffins, but not pasta.\n</PREMISES>\n<CONCLUSION>\nLuke can make a good breakfast.\n</CONCLUSION>\n<EVALUATE>\n\nLet's think step by step. We want to evaluate if Luke can make a good breakfast. From the last premise, we know that Luke can make cookies, scrambled eggs, and muffins. Since Luke can make cookies and muffins, they are a baker. Now, combining the information we have, since Luke is a baker and can make scrambled eggs, this means that they can make a good breakfast. Therefore, Luke can make a good breakfast, so the statement is true.\nANSWER:\tTrue\n</EVALUATE>\n\n---\n<PREMISES>\nETS develops various standardized tests primarily in the United States for K-12 and higher education.\nETS administers international tests including the TOEFL, TOEIC, GRE and subject tests in more than 180 countries.\nMany of the assessments ETS develops are associated with entry to the US tertiary and quaternary education institutions.\nETS also develops K-12 statewide assessments used for accountability testing in many states.\n</PREMISES>\n<CONCLUSION>\nETS develops assessments for K-12 statewide as well as entry to US tertiary and quaternary education institutions.\n</CONCLUSION>\n<EVALUATE>\n\nLet's think step by step. We want to evaluate if ETS develops assessments for K-12 statewide as well as entry to US tertiary and quaternary educatiand doon institutions. We know that ETS develops assessments for K-12 statewide. We also know that ETS develops assessments associated with entry to the US tertiary and quaternary education institutes. Therefore, both parts of the conclusion are true, and the statement is true.\nANSWER:\tTrue\n</EVALUATE>\n\n---\n<PREMISES>\nChina is one of BRICS and its economy is emerging.\nIndia is one of BRICS and its economy is emerging.\nAll people from China speak Chinese.\nAll people from India speak Hindi or English.\nThere is an Indian.\n</PREMISES>\n<CONCLUSION>\nThere is a person from BRICS speaking Hindi.\n</CONCLUSION>\n<EVALUATE>\n\nLet's think step by step. We want to evaluate if there is a person from BRICS speaking Hindi. We know that there is an Indian, and since India is one of BRICS, we know that there is an Indian in BRICS. Furthermore, we know that they speak either Hindi or English, however, we don't know which one. Therefore, there could be a person in BRICS speaking Hindi, or there could not. Therefore, it is uncertain whether there is a person from BRICS speaking Hindi.\nANSWER:\tUncertain\n</EVALUATE>\n\n---\n\n<PREMISES>\nIf something can transport multiple passengers, then they are not one-seaters.\nAll corgis can transport multiple passengers.\nAll single-seat electric cars are one-seaters.\nAll Solo EV cars are single-seat electric cars.\nIf the Queen's dogs are not corgis, then the Queen's dogs are not corgis or a single-seat electric car.\n</PREMISES>\n<CONCLUSION>\nThe Queen's dogs are corgis.\n</CONCLUSION>\n<EVALUATE>\n", "raw_generations": ["Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if the Queen's dogs are corgis. From the premise \"If the Queen's dogs are not corgis, then the Queen's dogs are not corgis or a single-seat electric car,\" we can simplify the statement to \"If the Queen's dogs are not corgis, then they are not corgis,\" which is a tautology and doesn't provide new information.\n\nHowever, this statement does not give us any information about the Queen's dogs being corgis or not. The premises about corgis and transport do not directly relate to the Queen's dogs. Since there is no premise that definitively states or implies the Queen's dogs are corgis, we cannot conclude that the Queen's dogs are corgis.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is uncertain based on the given premises.\nANSWER: Uncertain\n", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if the Queen's dogs are corgis. We are given the following information: \n- If something can transport multiple passengers, then they are not one-seaters.\n- All corgis can transport multiple passengers.\n- All single-seat electric cars are one-seaters.\n- All Solo EV cars are single-seat electric cars.\n- If the Queen's dogs are not corgis, then the Queen's dogs are not corgis or a single-seat electric car.\n\nFrom the second premise, all corgis can transport multiple passengers, and from the first premise, if something can transport multiple passengers, then they are not one-seaters. Therefore, all corgis are not one-seaters. \n\nNow, we focus on the last premise: \"If the Queen's dogs are not corgis, then the Queen's dogs are not corgis or a single-seat electric car.\" This premise is a tautology because the statement \"the Queen's dogs are not corgis\" is repeated, which means it does not provide any additional information about whether the Queen's dogs are corgis or not. We need to rely on other premises.\n\nSince we do not have any premises that directly state or imply that the Queen's dogs are not corgis, we cannot conclude that they are not corgis. Therefore, the only information we have suggests that the Queen's dogs could be corgis. \n\nHowever, there is no direct evidence in the premises to confirm this. Therefore, the statement is uncertain.\nANSWER: Uncertain\n", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if the Queen's dogs are corgis. From the last premise, we have the statement \"If the Queen's dogs are not corgis, then the Queen's dogs are not corgis or a single-seat electric car.\" This is a tautology because the consequent of the conditional (\"the Queen's dogs are not corgis or a single-seat electric car\") is always true if the antecedent (\"the Queen's dogs are not corgis\") is true. This means the statement doesn't provide any new information about whether the Queen's dogs are corgis or not. Since there are no other premises that provide direct information about the Queen's dogs being corgis or not, we cannot determine whether the Queen's dogs are corgis.\n\nANSWER: Uncertain\n", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if the Queen's dogs are corgis. From premise 5, we have the statement \"If the Queen's dogs are not corgis, then the Queen's dogs are not corgis or a single-seat electric car.\" This is a tautology because the consequent (Queen's dogs are not corgis or a single-seat electric car) is always true if the antecedent (Queen's dogs are not corgis) is true. Therefore, this premise does not give us any new information about the Queen's dogs. The only information we have about the Queen's dogs is from this tautological premise, which does not help us determine if they are corgis.

All Solo EV cars are single-seat electric cars.\n5. If the Queen's dogs are not corgis, then the Queen's dogs are not corgis or a single-seat electric car.\n\nFrom premise 2, all corgis can transport multiple passengers. From premise 1, if something can transport multiple passengers, then they are not one-seaters. Therefore, corgis are not one-seaters.\n\nFrom premise 5, \"If the Queen's dogs are not corgis, then the Queen's dogs are not corgis or a single-seat electric car.\" This statement is always true because it's a tautology (if not A, then not A or B), which doesn't provide any useful information about the nature of the Queen's dogs.\n\nSince premise 5 does not give us any definitive information, we cannot conclude that the Queen's dogs are corgis based on the given premises. Therefore, the statement is uncertain.\nANSWER: Uncertain\n", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if the Queen's dogs are corgis. From the premise \"If the Queen's dogs are not corgis, then the Queen's dogs are not corgis or a single-seat electric car,\" we know that the premise is vacuously true because it is a tautology (it's always true regardless of the conditions). This does not give us any specific information about whether the Queen's dogs are corgis or not. Therefore, we cannot determine from the premises if the Queen's dogs are corgis.\n\nANSWER: Uncertain\n", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if the Queen's dogs are corgis. We start with the given premise: \"If the Queen's dogs are not corgis, then the Queen's dogs are not corgis or a single-seat electric car.\" This is a conditional statement where the antecedent (Queen's dogs are not corgis) implies the consequent (Queen's dogs are not corgis or a single-seat electric car). \n\nThe consequent \"Queen's dogs are not corgis or a single-seat electric car\" is always true if the antecedent \"Queen's dogs are not corgis\" is true, since the disjunction (or statement) will be true if either part is true. This means the statement doesn't provide new information if the Queen's dogs are not corgis, but it does confirm that if they are corgis, the statement is vacuously true. \n\nHowever, we also know from the other premises that all corgis can transport multiple passengers, which means they are not one-seaters. The premise also states that all single-seat electric cars are one-seaters, and all Solo EV cars are single-seat electric cars, thus Solo EV cars are also one-seaters. \n\nSince the statement \"If the Queen's dogs are not corgis, then the Queen's dogs are not corgis or a single-seat electric car\" doesn't give us definitive information about the Queen's dogs being corgis, we must conclude that we don't have enough information to definitively say the Queen's dogs are corgis.\n\nThus, the conclusion is uncertain.\nANSWER: Uncertain\n", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if the Queen's dogs are corgis. From premise 4, we know that the Queen's dogs are not corgis or a single-seat electric car. We can break this down into two cases:\n\n1. The Queen's dogs are not corgis.\n2. The Queen's dogs are not a single-seat electric car.\n\nIf the Queen's dogs are corgis, then premise 4 implies that they cannot be a single-seat electric car, which is consistent. However, if the Queen's dogs are not corgis, then premise 4 is still satisfied. There is no information in the premises that explicitly states whether the Queen's dogs are corgis or not, and premise 4 does not provide sufficient information to determine whether the Queen's dogs are corgis or not. Therefore, it is uncertain whether the Queen's dogs are corgis.\nANSWER: Uncertain\n", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if the Queen's dogs are corgis. From the last premise, we see that if the Queen's dogs are not corgis, then the Queen's dogs are not corgis or a single-seat electric car. This statement is redundant since it is always true by definition. It doesn't give us any new information. We need to look at the rest of the premises to see if we can deduce the type of the Queen's dogs.\n\nFrom premise 2, we know that all corgis can transport multiple passengers. From premise 1, if something can transport multiple passengers, then they are not one-seaters. Hence, all corgis are not one-seaters. \n\nFrom premises 3 and 4, all Solo EV cars are one-seaters because they are single-seat electric cars.\n\nSince the Queen's dogs are not one-seaters (if they are corgis), and Solo EV cars are one-seaters, it means the Queen's dogs cannot be Solo EV cars. \n\nHowever, the premises do not provide information about whether the Queen's dogs are corgis or some other type of dog. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that the Queen's dogs are corgis.\n\nANSWER: Uncertain\n", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if the Queen's dogs are corgis. From premise 1, if something can transport multiple passengers, then they are not one-seaters. From premise 2, all corgis can transport multiple passengers, so corgis are not one-seaters. From premise 3, all single-seat electric cars are one-seaters. From premise 4, all Solo EV cars are single-seat electric cars, so they are also one-seaters. Finally, from premise 5, if the Queen's dogs are not corgis, then the Queen's dogs are not corgis or a single-seat electric car. This premise is a tautology because it's always true, and it doesn't provide any additional information about whether the Queen's dogs are corgis.\n\nTherefore, we cannot derive any information from the premises that definitively states the Queen's dogs are corgis. We don't have any direct information about the Queen's dogs, except that if they are not corgis, they cannot be a single-seat electric car, which doesn't help us confirm or deny if they are corgis. \n\nTherefore, it is uncertain whether the Queen's dogs are corgis.\nANSWER: Uncertain\n"], "answers": ["Uncertain", "Uncertain", "Uncertain", "Uncertain", "Uncertain", "Uncertain", "Uncertain", "Uncertain", "Uncertain", "Uncertain"], "reference": "Uncertain", "time_total": 107.06807279586792, "time_llm": 107.06696510314941, "prompt_length": 8691}
