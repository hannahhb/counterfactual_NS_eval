Note: In the above FOL expression, "LocatedIn(HardingPegmatiteMine, MountainRangeInNewMexico)" is used as a shorthand for "LocatedIn(HardingPegmatiteMine, MountainRange(X)) & MountainRange(X, NewMexico)". This simplification assumes that the name "MountainRangeInNewMexico" uniquely identifies any mountain range in New Mexico without additional context.
  
To properly handle this, one would typically define a predicate `MountainRangeInNewMexico(x)` to mean `MountainRange(x, NewMexico)`.

Let's redefine with proper predicate notation:

TEXT: The Picuris Mountains are a mountain range in New Mexico or Texas.
FOL: (MountainRange(PicurisMountains, NewMexico) | MountainRange(PicurisMountains, Texas))

TEXT: Juan de Onate visited the Picuris Mountains.
FOL: Visited(JuanDeOnate, PicurisMountains)

TEXT: There are no mountain ranges in Texas that have mines that have been donated.
FOL: -(exists x. (MountainRange(x, Texas) & LocatedIn(y, x) & Donated(y)))

TEXT: The Harding Pegmatite Mine is not located in a mountain range in New Mexico.
FOL: -LocatedIn(HardingPegmatiteMine, MountainRangeInNewMexico)

TEXT: Mountain range in New Mexico.
FOL: MountainRangeInNewMexico(x) :<=> MountainRange(x, NewMexico)

Now we have:
TEXT: The Harding Pegmatite Mine is not located in a mountain range in New Mexico.

FOL: FliesFrom(John, LGA)

TEXT: John flies to LGA airport.
FOL: FliesTo(John, LGA)
</EVALUATE>

However, based on the premises provided, we cannot conclude that "John flies to LGA airport." Here's why:

1. **Premise 1**: Susan flies to LGA airport. (FliesTo(Susan, LGA))
2. **Premise 2**: The departure and arrival can not be at the same airport. (all x. all y. (FliesFrom(x, y) & FliesTo(x, y) -> False))
3. **Premise 3**: John flies from LGA airport. (FliesFrom(John, LGA))

Given Premise 2, it's clear that if someone departs from an airport, they cannot arrive at the same airport. But this does not directly provide information about where John arrives.

Since Premise 3 only tells us that John departs from LGA, but does not give any information about his destination, we cannot infer from the given premises alone that John flies to LGA airport. Therefore, the
