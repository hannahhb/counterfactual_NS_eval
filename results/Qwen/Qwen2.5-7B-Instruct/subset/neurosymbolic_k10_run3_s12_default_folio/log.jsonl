{"idx": 1, "prompt": "The following is a first-order logic (FOL) problem.\nThe problem is to determine whether the conclusion follows from the premises.\nThe premises are given in the form of a set of first-order logic sentences.\nThe conclusion is given in the form of a single first-order logic sentence.\nThe task is to translate each of the premises and conclusions into FOL expressions so that the expressions can be evaluated by a theorem solver like Prover9 to determine whether the conclusion follows from the premises.\nExpressions should adhere to the format of the Python NLTK package logic module.\n\nPredicate/arity map for the problem:\n['Fish/1', 'StingsPeople/1', 'Stonefish/1', 'TreatsSting/2', 'CausesDeath/2']\n\nNow, let's translate the premises and conclusion into FOL expressions using the provided predicate/arity map.\n\n**Premises:**\n1.

Yevgeny Kurochkin discovered a new bird genus.\n   - `Discovered(YevgenyKurochkin, Genus(new))`\n\nNote: Since we need to express that Yevgeny Kurochkin discovered a new bird genus, we introduce a new constant `Genus(new)` to represent this new genus.\n\nThese translations can now be input into a theorem prover like Prover9 to check if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. \n\n<PREMISES>\nAll dispensable things are environment-friendly.\nAll woodware is dispensable.\nAll paper is woodware.\nNo good things are bad.\nAll environment-friendly things are good.\nA worksheet is either paper or is environment-friendly.\n</PREMISES>\n<CONCLUSION>\nA worksheet is not dispensable.\n</CONCLUSION>\n<EVALUATE>\nPredicate/arity map for the problem: \n ['Bad/1', 'Dispensable/1', 'EnvironmentFriendly/1', 'Good/1', 'Paper/1', 'Woodware/1']TEXT: All dispensable things are environment-friendly. \nFOL: all x.

{"idx": 6, "prompt": "The following is a first-order logic (FOL) problem.\nThe problem is to determine whether the conclusion follows from the premises.\nThe premises are given in the form of a set of first-order logic sentences.\nThe conclusion is given in the form of a single first-order logic sentence.\nThe task is to translate each of the premises and conclusions into FOL expressions so that the expressions can be evaluated by a theorem solver like Prover9 to determine whether the conclusion follows from the premises.\nExpressions should adhere to the format of the Python NLTK package logic module.\n\nPredicate/arity map for the problem:\n['Built/2', 'CurrentName/2', 'LocatedIn/2', 'NewFrance/1', 'Europe/1']\n\n---\n\nNow let's translate the premises and the conclusion into FOL expressions using the provided predicate/arity map:\n\n**Premises:**\n\n1. `CurrentName(\"Fort Ticonderoga\", \"Fort Carillon\").`\n2. `Built(\"Pierre de Rigaud de Vaudreuil\", \"Fort Carillon\").`\n3. `LocatedIn(\"Fort Carillon\", \"New France\").`\n4. `NotLocatedIn(\"New France\", \"Europe\").`\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n5. `Built(\"Pierre de Rigaud de Vaudreuil\", \"New France\").`\n\nNote: The predicate `NotLocatedIn` is used to express that \"New France is not in Europe.\" However, since we need to express that Pierre de Rigaud de Vaudreuil built a fort in New France, we directly use the `Built` predicate with the fort's current name.\n\nThe FOL expressions for the premises and the conclusion are as follows:\n\n**Premises:**\n\n1. `CurrentName(\"Fort Ticonderoga\", \"Fort Carillon\").`\n2. `Built(\"Pierre de Rigaud de Vaudreuil\", \"Fort Carillon\").`\n3. `LocatedIn(\"Fort Carillon\", \"New France\").`\n4. `NotLocatedIn(\"New France\", \"Europe\").`\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n5. `Built(\"Pierre de Rigaud de Vaudreuil\", \"New France\").`\n\nThese expressions can now be evaluated by a theorem solver like Prover9 to determine whether the conclusion follows from the premises. \n\n<PREMISES>\nAll dispensable things are environment-friendly.\nAll woodware is dispensable.\nAll paper is woodware.\nNo good things are bad.\nAll environment-friendly things are good.\nA worksheet is either paper or is environment-friendly.\n</PREMISES>\n<CONCLUSION>\nA worksheet is not dispensable.\n</CONCLUSION>\n<EVALUATE>\nPredicate/arity map for the problem: \n ['Bad/1', 'Dispensable/1', 'EnvironmentFriendly/1', 'Good/1', 'Paper/1', 'Woodware/1']TEXT: All dispensable things are environment-friendly. \nFOL: all x.

{"idx": 9, "prompt": "The following is a first-order logic (FOL) problem.\nThe problem is to determine whether the conclusion follows from the premises.\nThe premises are given in the form of a set of first-order logic sentences.\nThe conclusion is given in the form of a single first-order logic sentence.\nThe task is to translate each of the premises and conclusions into FOL expressions so that the expressions can be evaluated by a theorem solver like Prover9 to determine whether the conclusion follows from the premises.\nExpressions should adhere to the format of the Python NLTK package logic module.\n\nPredicate/arity map for the problem: \n['District/2', 'City/1']\n\n---\n\nNow, let's translate the premises and conclusion into FOL expressions using the provided predicate/arity map:\n\n### Premises:\n1. **Xiufeng, Xiangshan, Diecai, Qixing are districts in the city of Guilin.**\n   - `District('Xiufeng', 'Guilin')`\n   - `District('Xiangshan', 'Guilin')`\n   - `District('Diecai', 'Guilin')`\n   - `District('Qixing', 'Guilin')`\n\n2. **Yangshuo is not a district in Guilin.**\n   - `~District('Yangshuo', 'Guilin')`\n\n### Conclusion:\n- **Xiangshan and Diecai are districts in the same city.**\n  - `City('Xiangshan', 'Diecai')` or `City('Diecai', 'Xiangshan')`\n\nGiven the structure of the problem, we don't need to express that they are in the same city explicitly since the fact that they are both districts in Guilin already implies this. However, if you want to formalize it further, you could use the `City/1` predicate to ensure they are in the same city:\n\n- `City('Xiangshan', 'Guilin') \u2227 City('Diecai', 'Guilin')`\n\nSo, the final FOL expressions would be:\n\n### Premises:\n```\nDistrict('Xiufeng', 'Guilin')\nDistrict('Xiangshan', 'Guilin')\nDistrict('Diecai', 'Guilin')\nDistrict('Qixing', 'Guilin')\n~District('Yangshuo', 'Guilin')\n```\n\n### Conclusion:\n```\nCity('Xiangshan', 'Guilin') \u2227 City('Diecai', 'Guilin')\n```\n\nThese expressions can now be evaluated by a theorem solver like Prover9 to determine if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. \n\n<PREMISES>\nAll dispensable things are environment-friendly.\nAll woodware is dispensable.\nAll paper is woodware.\nNo good things are bad.\nAll environment-friendly things are good.\nA worksheet is either paper or is environment-friendly.\n</PREMISES>\n<CONCLUSION>\nA worksheet is not dispensable.\n</CONCLUSION>\n<EVALUATE>\nPredicate/arity map for the problem: \n ['Bad/1', 'Dispensable/1', 'EnvironmentFriendly/1', 'Good/1', 'Paper/1', 'Woodware/1']TEXT: All dispensable things are environment-friendly. \nFOL: all x.

{"idx": 22, "prompt": "The following is a first-order logic (FOL) problem.\nThe problem is to determine whether the conclusion follows from the premises.\nThe premises are given in the form of a set of first-order logic sentences.\nThe conclusion is given in the form of a single first-order logic sentence.\nThe task is to translate each of the premises and conclusions into FOL expressions so that the expressions can be evaluated by a theorem solver like Prover9 to determine whether the conclusion follows from the premises.\nExpressions should adhere to the format of the Python NLTK package logic module.\n\nPredicate/arity map for the problem:\n['RealNumber/1', 'Larger/2', 'Positive/1', 'DoubleOf/2']\n\n---\n\nNow let's translate the premises and the conclusion into FOL expressions using the provided predicate/arity map:\n\n### Premises\n\n1. Six, seven and eight are real numbers.\n   - \\( \\text{RealNumber}(6) \\)\n   - \\( \\text{RealNumber}(7) \\)\n   - \\( \\text{RealNumber}(8) \\)\n\n2. If a real number equals another real number added by one, the first number is larger.\n   - \\( \\forall x \\forall y (\\text{RealNumber}(x) \\land \\text{RealNumber}(y) \\land x = y + 1 \\rightarrow \\text{Larger}(x, y)) \\)\n\n3. If the number \\( x \\) is larger than the number \\( y \\), then \\( y \\) is not larger than \\( x \\).\n   - \\( \\forall x \\forall y (\\text{Larger}(x, y) \\rightarrow \\neg \\text{Larger}(y, x)) \\)\n\n4. Seven equals six plus one.\n   - \\( 7 = 6 + 1 \\)\n   - \\( \\text{RealNumber}(6) \\land \\text{RealNumber}(7) \\land 7 = 6 + 1 \\)\n\n5. Eight equals seven plus one.\n   - \\( 8 = 7 + 1 \\)\n   - \\( \\text{RealNumber}(7) \\land \\text{RealNumber}(8) \\land 8 = 7 + 1 \\)\n\n6. Two is positive.\n   - \\( \\text{Positive}(2) \\)\n\n7. If a number is positive, then the double of it is also positive.\n   - \\( \\forall x (\\text{Positive}(x) \\rightarrow \\text{Positive}(\\text{DoubleOf}(x, x))) \\)\n\n8. Eight is the double of four.\n   - \\( \\text{DoubleOf}(8, 4) \\)\n\n9. Four is the double of two.\n   - \\( \\text{DoubleOf}(4, 2) \\)\n\n### Conclusion\n\n1. Six is larger than seven.\n   - \\( \\text{Larger}(6, 7) \\)\n\n### Evaluation\n\nWe need to determine if the conclusion \\( \\text{Larger}(6, 7) \\) follows from the premises. We can use a theorem prover like Prover9 to check this. Here are the translated expressions in a format that can be directly input into Prover9:\n\n```\n% Premises\n(RealNumber(6))\n(RealNumber(7))\n(RealNumber(8))\n(\u2200x\u2200y((RealNumber(x) \u2227 RealNumber(y) \u2227 x = y + 1) \u2192 Larger(x, y)))\n(\u2200x\u2200y((Larger(x, y) \u2192 \u00acLarger(y, x))))\n(RealNumber(6) \u2227 RealNumber(7) \u2227 7 = 6 + 1)\n(RealNumber(7) \u2227 RealNumber(8) \u2227 8 = 7 + 1)\n(Positive(2))\n(\u2200x((Positive(x) \u2192 Positive(DoubleOf(x, x)))))\n(DoubleOf(8, 4))\n(DoubleOf(4, 2))\n\n% Conclusion\n(Larger(6, 7))\n```\n\nThis set of FOL expressions can be fed into a theorem prover like Prover9 to check if the conclusion follows logically from the premises. \n\n<PREMISES>\nAll dispensable things are environment-friendly.\nAll woodware is dispensable.\nAll paper is woodware.\nNo good things are bad.\nAll environment-friendly things are good.\nA worksheet is either paper or is environment-friendly.\n</PREMISES>\n<CONCLUSION>\nA worksheet is not dispensable.\n</CONCLUSION>\n<EVALUATE>\nPredicate/arity map for the problem: \n ['Bad/1', 'Dispensable/1', 'EnvironmentFriendly/1', 'Good/1', 'Paper/1', 'Woodware/1']TEXT: All dispensable things are environment-friendly. \nFOL: all x.

{"idx": 37, "prompt": "The following is a first-order logic (FOL) problem.\nThe problem is to determine whether the conclusion follows from the premises.\nThe premises are given in the form of a set of first-order logic sentences.\nThe conclusion is given in the form of a single first-order logic sentence.\nThe task is to translate each of the premises and conclusions into FOL expressions so that the expressions can be evaluated by a theorem solver like Prover9 to determine whether the conclusion follows from the premises.\nExpressions should adhere to the format of the Python NLTK package logic module.\n\nPredicate/arity map for the problem:\n['Produced/2', 'PeakAtNo1/2', 'Popular/1']\n\nExplanation of the predicates:\n- `Produced(WhiteTown, song)` indicates that White Town produced the song.\n- `PeakAtNo1(song, place)` indicates that the song peaked at No. 1 in the specified place.\n- `Popular(song)` indicates that the song was popular.\n\nThe predicates are kept simple and directly related to the information provided in the premises. There is no redundancy or unnecessary length in the predicate names.\n\nNow, let's translate the premises and conclusion into FOL expressions using these predicates:\n\n**Premises:**\n1. \"Your Woman\" is a song by the British one-person band White Town.\n   - `Produced(WhiteTown, YourWoman)`\n2. \"Your Woman\" song peaked at No. 1 on the UK Singles Chart.\n   - `PeakAtNo1(YourWoman, UK)`\n3.
