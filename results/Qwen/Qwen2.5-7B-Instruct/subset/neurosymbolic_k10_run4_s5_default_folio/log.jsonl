Yevgeny Kurochkin discovered `X`.\n\nHowever, since we know that Ambiortus Dementjevi is the only known species of Ambiortus, and Yevgeny Kurochkin discovered Ambiortus, we need to reformulate the conclusion to reflect this knowledge correctly:\n\nTEXT: Yevgeny Kurochkin discovered a new bird genus.\nFOL: (BirdGenus(X) & -KnownSpeciesOf(AmbiortusDementjevi, X) & Discoverer(YevgenyKurochkin, X))\n\nSince we already know that Yevgeny Kurochkin discovered Ambiortus and Ambiortus is a prehistoric bird genus, we can conclude that he did indeed discover a new bird genus if we assume that Ambiortus was not previously known.

Since `NewYorkCity` is a highly developed city (`HighlyDevelopedCity(NewYorkCity)`), and `NewYorkCity` is located in `NorthAmerica` and `NorthAmerica` is in the `WesternHemisphere` of the earth (`WesternHemisphere(NorthAmerica)`), we can conclude:\n   - Any object located in `NorthAmerica` is also located in the `WesternHemisphere`. Therefore, since `NewYorkCity` is located in the `WesternHemisphere`, and `NewYorkCity` is a highly developed city, every highly developed city must also be in the `WesternHemisphere`.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion:\n```\nall x.

If Prover9 can derive the conclusion, then it follows from the premises. If it cannot derive the conclusion, then the conclusion does not follow from the premises.\n\nGiven the premises provided, let's analyze the logical structure:\n\n1. **Premise Analysis**:\n   - If a mammal lays eggs, it must be either a platypus or an echidna.\n   - Hyraxes are not platypuses or echidnas.\n   - Therefore, no hyraxes can lay eggs based on the given information.\n\n2. **Conclusion**:\n   - The statement \"Hyraxes lay eggs\" directly contradicts the derived fact that no hyraxes can lay eggs.\n\nTherefore, based on the premises provided, the conclusion \"Hyraxes lay eggs\" does not follow from the premises.", "TEXT: The only types of mammals that lay eggs are either platypuses or echidnas.\nFOL: all x.

(AdministersTest(ETS, x) -> International(x) -> False)\n\nHowever, there is an issue with how the premises are formulated. Specifically, the premise \"ETS develops various standardized tests primarily in the United States for K-12 and higher education\" suggests that developing tests is related to K-12, Tertiary, and Quaternary education, but it does not directly relate to the international scope in the same way as administering tests. The premise \"ETS administers international tests, including the TOEFL, TOEIC, GRE, and subject tests\" explicitly states that ETS administers international tests. Therefore, it's impossible for the conclusion to logically follow from these premises based on the information provided.\n\nThe correct formulation would need to be:\n- ETS administers international tests.\n- ETS does not administer tests internationally.\n\nGiven the provided premises, the conclusion cannot logically follow because the premises already state that ETS administers international tests, which directly contradicts the conclusion.\n\nFor clarity and correctness, let's rephrase the premises and conclusion appropriately:\n\n**Corrected Premises:**\n1. ETS administers international tests, including the TOEFL, TOEIC, GRE, and subject tests.\n2. ETS develops various standardized tests primarily in the United States for K-12 and higher education.\n3. ETS also develops K-12 statewide assessments used for accountability testing in many states.\n4. Many of the assessments ETS develops are associated with entry to the US tertiary and quaternary education institutions.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nETS administers international tests.\n\nThis way, the conclusion directly follows from the first premise. Here are the FOL formulations:\n\n**Premises:**\n1.

Let's use a logical reasoning approach to evaluate this.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Every artificial satellite is an important scientific achievement.\n   - Formally, \\( \\forall x (\\text{ArtificialSatellite}(x) \\rightarrow \\text{ImportantScientificAchievement}(x)) \\).\n\n2. **Premise 2**: There exists an artificial satellite that is not a U.S. invention.\n   - Formally, \\( \\exists x (\\text{ArtificialSatellite}(x) \\land \\neg \\text{UsInvention}(x)) \\).\n\n3. **Conclusion**: Every important scientific achievement is a U.S. invention.\n   - Formally, \\( \\forall x (\\text{ImportantScientificAchievement}(x) \\rightarrow \\text{UsInvention}(x)) \\).\n\n### Analysis\n\nFrom Premise 1, we know:\n- If something is an artificial satellite, then it must be an important scientific achievement.\n\nHowever, Premise 2 tells us that there is at least one artificial satellite that is not a U.S. invention. This means there is a counterexample to the statement that all important scientific achievements are U.S. inventions.\n\nSince there is an important scientific achievement (an artificial satellite) that is not a U.S. invention, the statement \"all important scientific achievements are U.S. inventions\" cannot be true. Therefore, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe conclusion \"All important scientific achievements are U.S. inventions\" does not follow from the premises given.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{The conclusion does not follow from the premises.}} \\]", "TEXT: All artificial satellites are important scientific achievements.\nFOL: all x.

The goal is to check if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nHere\u2019s how you would structure the input for Prover9:\n\n```plaintext\nformulas(assumptions).\n  all x.

All artificial satellites are important scientific achievements.\n2. Some artificial satellites are not U.S. inventions.\n\nWe need to determine if:\n3. All important scientific achievements are U.S. inventions.\n\nThis is a classic case where the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises. Here\u2019s why:\n\n- From premise 1, we know every artificial satellite is an important scientific achievement.\n- Premise 2 states that there exist artificial satellites that are not U.S. inventions.\n- Therefore, there must be important scientific achievements (specifically, those artificial satellites) that are not U.S. inventions.\n\nSince there are important scientific achievements that are not U.S. inventions, it is not possible for all important scientific achievements to be U.S. inventions.\n\nThus, the conclusion \"All important scientific achievements are U.S. inventions\" does not logically follow from the premises."], "answers": ["True", "False", "False", "True", "False", "False", "False", "False", "False", "False"], "reference": "False", "time_total": 57.06630992889404, "time_llm": 57.01064658164978, "prompt_length": 8230}

If the negation of the conclusion cannot be derived, then the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nLet's represent this in a way that can be input into Prover9:\n\n```\n% Premises\nall x. (Depressing(x) -> Sad(x))\nDepressing(RelationshipEnd)\n\n% Conclusion\nInvigorating(RelationshipEnd)\n\n% Convert to clause form for Prover9\n(not Depressing(x) | Sad(x))\nDepressing(RelationshipEnd)\n(-Invigorating(RelationshipEnd))\n\n% Combine all clauses\n% (Prover9 syntax)\n% (fof(premise1, axiom, (all x.

If Prover9 finds a proof for the negated conclusion, then the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.\n\nIn this case, since the conclusion states \"The end of a relationship is invigorating,\" and we have as a premise that \"The end of a relationship is depressing\" and \"When something is depressing, it is sad,\" it is clear that the end of a relationship cannot be both depressing and invigorating.

(Depressing(x) -> Sad(x))`\n   - `RelationshipEnd(TheEndOfARelationship) -> Depressing(TheEndOfARelationship)`\n\n2. **Conclusion:**\n   - `Invigorating(TheEndOfARelationship)`\n\n### Translation and Evaluation:\n- We know from the premises that `TheEndOfARelationship` is depressing because `RelationshipEnd(TheEndOfARelationship) -> Depressing(TheEndOfARelationship)` is true.\n- From the definition of depression (`Depressing(x) -> Sad(x)`), we can infer that `TheEndOfARelationship` is sad.\n\nHowever, the conclusion states that `TheEndOfARelationship` is invigorating. This directly contradicts the information provided by the premises. Since being invigorating is incompatible with being sad (assuming \"invigorating\" means something positive and not sad), the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe conclusion \"The end of a relationship is invigorating\" does not logically follow from the premises given.", "TEXT: When something is depressing, it is sad.\nFOL: all x.

Since the first premise states that Tyga is a rapper, this directly contradicts the conclusion that Tyga is an opera singer. Therefore, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.\n\nTo confirm this with a theorem prover, you would input the above FOL statements into Prover9 and attempt to prove the conclusion.

However, since Prover9 works with specific formats and we need to ensure our FOL expressions are correctly translated, let's proceed with the translation provided above.\n\nTo check if the conclusion follows from the premises, we would input these FOL expressions into Prover9 and see if it can derive the conclusion. Here is how you would structure the input for Prover9:\n\n```prolog\n% Premises\nbest_known_artwork(TheMonaLisa).\nportrait(TheMonaLisa).\npainter_by(TheMonaLisa, LeonardoDaVinci).\nscientist(LeonardoDaVinci).\npainter(LeonardoDaVinci).\n\n% Define genre as one of the possible values\ngenre_of(_, history).\ngenre_of(_, portrait).\ngenre_of(_, animal).\ngenre_of(_, landscape).\ngenre_of(_, still_life).\n\n% Conclusion\nnot_best_known_artwork_is_portrait.\n\n% Negation of the conclusion to be refuted\nnot_not_best_known_artwork_is_portrait(BestKnownArtwork, Portrait).\n\n% Goal to prove\nprove_not_best_known_artwork_is_portrait.\n```\n\nHere, `prove_not_best_known_artwork_is_portrait` is the goal to prove. If Prover9 can derive this goal from the premises, the conclusion would be shown to be false, meaning that no world's best-known artworks are portraits does not logically follow from the given premises.\n\nLet's run this through Prover9 to see if the conclusion holds:\n\n1. Input the above Prolog code into Prover9.\n2. Run the solver.\n\nIf Prover9 cannot derive the conclusion, it means the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.

However, based on the provided premises, the conclusion does not logically follow. Let's break down why:\n\n1. We know that `NationalLobsterHatchery` is a specific instance of a `hatchery` and it is `open to visitors`.\n2. The statement \"A hatchery is either for profit or for conservation\" means every hatchery falls into one of these two categories.\n3. `NationalLobsterHatchery` is explicitly stated to be `not for profit`, which means it must be `for conservation`.\n4. The premise about conservation hatcheries potentially releasing animals into the wild is irrelevant to the current conclusion.\n5. The fact that `NationalLobsterHatchery` is open to visitors does not imply that all hatcheries are open to visitors. It only proves that at least one hatchery (the National Lobster Hatchery) is open to visitors.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"all hatcheries are open to visitors\" does not logically follow from the given premises. The correct translation and evaluation show this clearly.", "TEXT: The National Lobster Hatchery is a hatchery located in Padstow, England.\nFOL: Hatchery(NationalLobsterHatchery) & LocatedIn(NationalLobsterHatchery, Padstow) & England(Padstow)\n\nTEXT: The National Lobster Hatchery is open to visitors.\nFOL: OpenToVisitors(NationalLobsterHatchery)\n\nTEXT: A hatchery is either for profit or for conservation.\nFOL: all x.
