Each predicate captures a distinct relationship or property described in the problem. For example, `RealNumber/1` indicates that something is a real number, `IsPositive/1` indicates that a number is positive, `Equals/2` captures equality between two numbers, and `LargerThan/2` expresses the ordering relation between numbers. The `DoubleOf/2` predicate is used to express the doubling relationship between two numbers. \n\n<PREMISES>\nAll dispensable things are environment-friendly.\nAll woodware is dispensable.\nAll paper is woodware.\nNo good things are bad.\nAll environment-friendly things are good.\nA worksheet is either paper or is environment-friendly.\n</PREMISES>\n<CONCLUSION>\nA worksheet is not dispensable.\n</CONCLUSION>\n<EVALUATE>\nPredicate/arity map for the problem: \n ['Bad/1', 'Dispensable/1', 'EnvironmentFriendly/1', 'Good/1', 'Paper/1', 'Woodware/1']TEXT: All dispensable things are environment-friendly. \nFOL: all x.
