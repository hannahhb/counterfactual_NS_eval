It's a Holi-Holiday!\" was not in German #1 singles (\u00acG(\"Hooray! Hooray! It's a Holi-Holiday!\")).\n\n- From premise 4, if a song peaks below #1 on the German charts, it is not a #1 single in Germany (P(x) \u2192 \u00acG(x)). The contrapositive of this statement is \u00acG(x) \u2192 \u00acP(x), but this contrapositive is not directly helpful to prove the conclusion.\n\n- From premise 3, we have \u00acG(\"Hooray! Hooray!

It's a Holi-Holiday!\" was not a German #1 single, but does not provide information about whether it peaked below #1.\n\nThus, we cannot infer from the given premises that \"Hooray! Hooray!

However, this doesn't provide any direct information about whether John's car is a Tesla Model 3 or not. We have no information that contradicts TeslaModel3(JohnCar).\n\nTherefore, the conclusion that \"John's car is a Tesla Model 3\" is not directly contradicted by the premises, but it also isn't directly supported. Thus, we cannot conclusively state whether the conclusion is true or false based solely on the given information.\nANSWER:\tUncertain\n", "Let's translate the premises into FOL expressions and analyze:\n\n1. \u2200x (can_transport_multiple_passengers(x) \u2192 \u00acone_seater(x))\n2. \u2200x (Tesla_Model_3(x) \u2192 can_transport_multiple_passengers(x))\n3. \u2200x (single_seat_electric_car(x) \u2192 one_seater(x))\n4. \u2200x (Solo_EV(x) \u2192 single_seat_electric_car(x))\n5. \u2200x (\u00acTesla_Model_3(x) \u2192 (\u00acTesla_Model_3(x) \u2227 \u00acsingle_seat_electric_car(x)))\n\nWe need to evaluate if John's car is a Tesla Model 3.\n\nFrom Premise 5: If John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, then it is not a Tesla Model 3 or a single-seat electric car. This can be written as:\n   \u00acTesla_Model_3(John's car) \u2192 (\u00acTesla_Model_3(John's car) \u2227 \u00acsingle_seat_electric_car(John's car))\n\nSince the antecedent is the same as the first part of the consequent, this premise is redundant and does not provide new information about John's car.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible cases for John's car:\n\n1. If John's car is a Tesla Model 3:\n   - From Premise 2: John's car can transport multiple passengers.\n   - From Premise 1: John's car is not a one-seater.\n\n2. If John's car is not a Tesla Model 3:\n   - From Premise 5: John's car is not a Tesla Model 3 (already known) and not a single-seat electric car.\n   - So, John's car is not a Tesla Model 3 and not a one-seater.\n\nGiven that Premise 5 doesn't provide any additional information beyond what is already known, we cannot determine whether John's car is a Tesla Model 3 or not. The conclusion cannot be definitively proven true or false based on the premises.\n\nANSWER: Uncertain\n"], "answers": ["Uncertain", "Uncertain", "False", "Uncertain", "Uncertain", "False", "Uncertain", "Uncertain", "Uncertain", "Uncertain"], "reference": "Uncertain", "time_total": 121.88433527946472, "time_llm": 121.88356590270996, "prompt_length": 1742}
