We want to evaluate if the conclusion \"stings of some fish can cause death if not treated\" follows from the premises.\n\nFrom the premises, we know:\n1. Some fish sting people.\n2. Stonefish is a fish.\n3. Stonefish stings when stepped on.\n4. If a stonefish stings someone and they are not treated, it can cause death.\n5. To treat stonefish stings, apply heat or use antivenom.\n\nGiven these points, specifically point 4, we see that the sting of at least one type of fish (the stonefish) can indeed cause death if left untreated. Thus, the conclusion that \"stings of some fish can cause death if not treated\" is supported by the premises because it identifies at least one example (stonefish) that meets the condition stated in the conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises provided.\n\nANSWER: True", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if stings of some fish can cause death if not treated.\n\nFirst, let's break down the relevant premises:\n\n1. Some fish sting people.\n2. Stonefish is a fish.\n3. Stonefish stings when stepped on.\n4. If a stonefish stings someone and they are not treated, it can cause death.\n5. Treatment for stonefish stings involves applying heat to the affected area or using an antivenom.\n\nFrom these premises, we can deduce the following:\n- Stonefish falls under the category of fish that can sting people (premises 2 and 3).\n- The consequences of being stung by a stonefish without receiving treatment can be fatal (premise 4).\n\nGiven this information, we can conclude that there exist fish (specifically stonefish) whose stings can cause death if not treated. This directly supports the conclusion that \"stings of some fish can cause death if not treated.\"\n\nANSWER: True", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if the conclusion \"stings of some fish can cause death if not treated\" follows from the premises provided.\n\n1. **Premise Analysis**:\n   - Some fish sting people.\n   - Stonefish is a fish.\n   - Stonefish stings when stepped on.\n   - If a stonefish stings someone and they are not treated, it can cause death.\n   - Treatment involves applying heat or using an antivenom.\n\n2. **Relevant Information**:\n   - The key piece of information here is related to stonefish stings and their potential lethality if untreated.\n   - The premise explicitly states that a stonefish sting, if not treated, can cause death.\n   \n3. **Conclusion Evaluation**:\n   - The conclusion states that \"stings of some fish can cause death if not treated.\"\n   - Given that stonefish are a type of fish and that their sting can cause death if untreated, this directly supports the conclusion.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided premises, we can confidently say that the conclusion logically follows from the premises. \n\n**ANSWER: True**", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if the conclusion \"stings of some fish can cause death if not treated\" follows from the premises.\n\nFrom premise 1, we know that some fish sting people. Premise 2 identifies Stonefish as a fish. Premise 3 states that Stonefish stings when stepped on. Premise 4 tells us that if a stonefish stings someone and they are not treated, it can cause death to them. Finally, premise 5 provides methods to treat stonefish stings.\n\nGiven these premises, we know that:\n- There exists at least one type of fish (the stonefish) that stings.\n- The sting of a stonefish can be deadly if untreated.\n\nTherefore, because the stonefish is a type of fish that can potentially cause death through its sting if untreated, it follows logically that stings of some fish can indeed cause death if not treated.\n\nANSWER: True", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if the stings of some fish can cause death if not treated.\n\nFrom premise 1, we know that some fish sting people. This introduces the possibility that there exists at least one type of fish whose sting can harm humans. Premise 2 specifies that Stonefish is a fish, and premise 3 further clarifies that Stonefish stings when stepped on. Most importantly, premise 4 indicates that if a stonefish sting is left untreated, it can cause death.\n\nSince Stonefish is identified as a type of fish that can sting, and its sting can lead to death if not treated, we can conclude that some fish (at least Stonefish) have stings that can cause death if not treated.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"stings of some fish can cause death if not treated\" directly follows from the given premises.\n\nANSWER: True"], "answers": ["True", "True", "True", "True", "True", "True", "True", "True", "True", "True"], "reference": "True", "time_total": 91.01117444038391, "time_llm": 91.01058292388916, "prompt_length": 8426}

The only types of mammals that lay eggs are either platypuses or echidnas.\n2. Platypuses are not hyrax.\n3. Echidnas are not hyrax.\n4. No mammals are invertebrates.\n5. All animals are either vertebrates or invertebrates.\n6. Mammals are animals.\n7. Hyraxes are mammals.\n8. Grebes lay eggs.\n9. Grebes are not platypuses and also not echidnas.\n\nFrom these premises:\n- Premise 1 indicates that the ability to lay eggs is unique to platypuses and echidnas among mammals.\n- Premises 2 and 3 reinforce that hyraxes are different from both platypuses and echidnas.\n- Premises 4, 5, and 6 establish that mammals are vertebrates.\n- Premise 7 confirms that hyraxes are mammals.\n- Premises 8 and 9 provide information about grebes but don't directly relate to hyraxes laying eggs.\n\nGiven this, let's consider the conclusion: **Hyraxes lay eggs.**\n\nAccording to Premise 1, the only mammals that lay eggs are platypuses and echidnas. Hyraxes are not platypuses (Premise 2) and not echidnas (Premise 3). Hence, based on the provided premises, there is no information supporting that hyraxes lay eggs because they are not categorized as egg-laying mammals like platypuses and echidnas.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion does not follow from the premises.\n\n**Answer:** False", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if hyraxes lay eggs. \n\nFirstly, we know from the premises that the only types of mammals that lay eggs are either platypuses or echidnas. This means that if any mammal lays eggs, it must be either a platypus or an echidna.\n\nSecondly, we know that hyraxes are mammals (Premise 7). However, we also know that platypuses and echidnas are specifically identified as the only egg-laying mammals. Hyraxes are stated to be different from both platypuses and echidnas (Premises 4 and 5), indicating they do not belong to the categories of egg-laying mammals.\n\nGiven these points, since hyraxes are mammals but not platypuses or echidnas, we can conclude that hyraxes do not lay eggs.\n\nANSWER: False", "Let's think step by step.\n\nWe want to evaluate the statement \"Hyraxes lay eggs.\" Based on the premises provided:\n\n1. The only types of mammals that lay eggs are either platypuses or echidnas.\n2. Platypuses are not hyraxes.\n3. Echidnas are not hyraxes.\n4. No mammals are invertebrates.\n5. All animals are either vertebrates or invertebrates.\n6. Mammals are animals.\n7. Hyraxes are mammals.\n8. Grebes lay eggs.\n9. Grebes are not platypuses and also not echidnas.\n\nFrom these premises, we see that the ability to lay eggs among mammals is exclusive to platypuses and echidnas. Since it is stated that platypuses and echidnas are not hyraxes (premises 2 and 3), and given that hyraxes are mammals (premise 7), it follows logically that hyraxes cannot lay eggs. This is because only specific kinds of mammals, namely platypuses and echidnas, possess the characteristic of laying eggs, and hyraxes fall outside this category.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion that \"Hyraxes lay eggs\" does not follow from the premises provided.\n\nANSWER: False", "Let's think step by step.\n\nWe need to evaluate whether Hyraxes lay eggs based on the premises given.\n\n1. **Premise Analysis**:\n    - The only types of mammals that lay eggs are either platypuses or echidnas.\n    - Platypuses are not hyrax.\n    - Echidnas are not hyrax.\n    - No mammals are invertebrates.\n    - All animals are either vertebrates or invertebrates.\n    - Mammals are animals.\n    - Hyraxes are mammals.\n    - Grebes lay eggs.\n    - Grebes are not platypuses and also not echidnas.\n\n2. **Deduction**:\n    - According to the first premise, the only mammals that lay eggs are platypuses and echidnas.\n    - Platypuses are not hyrax (second premise).\n    - Echidnas are not hyrax (third premise).\n    - Since hyraxes are mammals (seventh premise), and the only egg-laying mammals are platypuses and echidnas, and hyraxes are neither platypuses nor echidnas, we conclude that hyraxes do not lay eggs.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"Hyraxes lay eggs\" does not follow from the premises.\n\n**ANSWER: False**", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if Hyraxes lay eggs.\n\n1. From the first premise, we know that the only types of mammals that lay eggs are platypuses or echidnas.\n2. Platypuses and echidnas are explicitly mentioned as the only egg-laying mammals.\n3. The premises also clarify that platypuses and echidnas are not hyraxes.\n4. We know that hyraxes are mammals from the sixth premise.\n5. Given that mammals are animals (premise 5) and all animals are either vertebrates or invertebrates (premise 4), and since no mammals are invertebrates (premise 3), all mammals are vertebrates.\n6. Finally, grebes lay eggs but are not platypuses or echidnas (premise 9). Grebes are birds, not mammals, but this does not impact our evaluation about hyraxes.\n\nSince platypuses and echidnas are the only mammals that lay eggs, and hyraxes are not platypuses or echidnas, hyraxes do not lay eggs. \n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"Hyraxes lay eggs\" is false.\nANSWER: False", "Let's think step by step.

Grebes lay eggs but are not platypuses or echidnas.\n\nGiven these points, let\u2019s analyze the conclusion that hyraxes lay eggs:\n\n- Premise 1 specifies that only platypuses and echidnas among mammals lay eggs. Since hyraxes are not platypuses and not echidnas (from premises 2 and 6), they do not fall into the category of egg-laying mammals.\n- Therefore, according to the premises, hyraxes do not lay eggs because they are not platypuses or echidnas.\n\nBased on the information provided, the statement \"hyraxes lay eggs\" is false.\n\nANSWER: False", "Let's think step by step.\n\nWe want to evaluate if hyraxes lay eggs. \n\nFrom the premises:\n- The only types of mammals that lay eggs are platypuses or echidnas.\n- Platypuses are not hyraxes.\n- Echidnas are not hyraxes.\n- No mammals are invertebrates.\n- All animals are either vertebrates or invertebrates.\n- Mammals are animals.\n- Hyraxes are mammals.\n- Grebes lay eggs, but grebes are not platypuses or echidnas.\n\nGiven these points:\n- Since the only egg-laying mammals are platypuses or echidnas, and hyraxes are neither platypuses nor echidnas, it means hyraxes do not lay eggs.\n- Hyraxes being mammals and mammals being animals aligns with the fact that hyraxes are vertebrates, and thus, since no mammals lay eggs except platypuses and echidnas, it is confirmed that hyraxes do not lay eggs.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"hyraxes lay eggs\" contradicts the given premises.\n\n**ANSWER: False**", "Let's think step by step.

According to premise 4, a song that is not a #1 single in Germany implies that the song peaked below #1 on the German charts. Therefore, since \"Hooray! Hooray! It's a Holi-Holiday!\" was not a German #1 single, it logically follows that it peaked below #1 on the German charts.\n\nANSWER: True", "Let's analyze the given premises and the conclusion step by step.\n\n### Premises\n\n1. Boney M. had several German #1 singles.\n2. \"Hooray! Hooray! It's a Holi-Holiday!\" was a big hit all over Europe.\n3. \"Hooray! Hooray! It's a Holi-Holiday!\" was not in German #1 singles.\n4. A song that peaks below #1 on the German charts is also a song that is not the #1 single in Germany.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n\"Hooray! Hooray! It's a Holi-Holiday!\" peaked below #1 on the German charts.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n- **Premise 1** tells us that Boney M. had multiple German #1 singles, but it does not provide specific information about any particular song, including \"Hooray! Hooray! It's a Holi-Holiday!\".\n- **Premise 2** indicates that \"Hooray! Hooray! It's a Holi-Holiday!\" was a big hit across Europe. This doesn't specify its performance in Germany specifically.\n- **Premise 3** directly states that \"Hooray! Hooray! It's a Holi-Holiday!\" did not reach the #1 spot on the German charts. This implies that the song did not achieve the top position in Germany.\n- **Premise 4** establishes that if a song peaks below #1 on the German charts, it is not considered the #1 single in Germany. This aligns with the information from Premise 3.\n\nSince Premise 3 already tells us that \"Hooray! Hooray! It's a Holi-Holiday!\" was not a #1 single in Germany, and Premise 4 confirms that any song not achieving #1 status would peak below #1, we can deduce that \"Hooray! Hooray! It's a Holi-Holiday!\" indeed peaked below #1 on the German charts.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the logical flow of the premises provided, the conclusion that \"Hooray! Hooray! It's a Holi-Holiday!\" peaked below #1 on the German charts logically follows.\n\n**ANSWER:** True", "Let's think step by step.\n\nWe need to evaluate if \"Hooray! Hooray!

It's a Holi-Holiday!\" was a big hit all over Europe.\n3. \"Hooray! Hooray! It's a Holi-Holiday!\" was not in German #1 singles.\n4. A song that peaks below #1 on the German charts is also a song that is not the #1 single in Germany.\n\nBased on the third premise, we know that \"Hooray! Hooray! It's a Holi-Holiday!\" was not a German #1 single. The fourth premise tells us that any song that is not a German #1 single must have peaked below #1 on the German charts.\n\nTherefore, since \"Hooray! Hooray! It's a Holi-Holiday!\" was not in German #1 singles, it must have peaked below #1 on the German charts.\n\nANSWER: True", "Let's think step by step. We need to evaluate whether \"Hooray! Hooray! It's a Holi-Holiday!\" peaked below #1 on the German charts.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Boney M. had several German #1 singles.\n2. **Premise 2**: \"Hooray! Hooray!

Hooray! It's a Holi-Holiday!\" was not a German #1 single. According to Premise 4, if a song is not the #1 single in Germany, then it must have peaked below #1 on the German charts.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, \"Hooray! Hooray! It's a Holi-Holiday!\" did indeed peak below #1 on the German charts.\n\n**ANSWER: True**", "Let's think step by step.\n\nWe want to evaluate whether \"Hooray! Hooray! It's a Holi-Holiday!\" peaked below #1 on the German charts based on the given premises:\n\n1. **Premise:** Boney M. had several German #1 singles.\n2. **Premise:** \"Hooray! Hooray! It's a Holi-Holiday!\" was a big hit all over Europe.\n3. **Premise:** \"Hooray! Hooray! It's a Holi-Holiday!\" was not in German #1 singles.\n4. **Premise:** A song that peaks below #1 on the German charts is also a song that is not the #1 single in Germany.\n\nFrom premise 3, we know \"Hooray! Hooray! It's a Holi-Holiday!\" was not a German #1 single. According to premise 4, any song that peaks below #1 on the German charts would also be a song that is not the #1 single in Germany. Since \"Hooray! Hooray! It's a Holi-Holiday!\" is explicitly stated as not being a German #1 single, it aligns with the condition described in premise 4.\n\nTherefore, given these premises, we can infer that \"Hooray! Hooray! It's a Holi-Holiday!\" indeed peaked below #1 on the German charts because it was not a #1 single in Germany.\n\n**ANSWER: True**", "Let's translate the premises and conclusion into FOL expressions and evaluate the argument.\n\n**Premises Translation to FOL:**\n1. \\( \\forall x (\\text{German\\#1}(x) \\rightarrow \\text{BiDeG}(x)) \\)\n   - All German #1 singles are Boney M.'s German #1 singles.\n   \n2. \\( \\exists x (\\text{Hit}(x) \\land \\text{Europe}(x) \\land x = \\text{\"Hooray!

From premise 3, we know that \"Hooray! Hooray! It's a Holi-Holiday!\" was not a German #1 single. \n2. Premise 4 tells us that if a song peaks below #1 on the German charts, then it is not a German #1 single.\n\nBy contrapositive, premise 4 implies that if a song is not a German #1 single, then it either peaked below #1 or did not peak at all. Given that premise 3 states \"Hooray! Hooray! It's a Holi-Holiday!\" is not a German #1 single, it logically follows from premise 4 that it either peaked below #1 or didn't reach #1 at all. However, the specific condition stated in the conclusion (peaking below #1) is directly supported by premise 4 given the negation from premise 3.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion follows from the premises.\n\n**ANSWER:** True", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if \"Hooray! Hooray! It's a Holi-Holiday!\" peaked below #1 on the German charts.\n\n1. Boney M. had several German #1 singles.\n2. \"Hooray! Hooray! It's a Holi-Holiday!\" was a big hit all over Europe.\n3. \"Hooray! Hooray! It's a Holi-Holiday!\" was not in German #1 singles.\n4. A song that peaks below #1 on the German charts is also a song that is not the #1 single in Germany.\n\nFrom Premise 3, we know that \"Hooray! Hooray! It's a Holi-Holiday!\" was not in the German #1 singles. According to Premise 4, any song that is not a German #1 single could have peaked below #1. However, Premise 4 only tells us about songs that peaked below #1 but does not cover all possibilities of non-#1 positions; it could have peaked at #2, #3, etc., or it could have never reached the charts.\n\nSince we only know that \"Hooray! Hooray! It's a Holi-Holiday!\" did not become a German #1 single, we cannot definitively conclude that it peaked below #1 without additional information about its exact chart position.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"Hooray! Hooray! It's a Holi-Holiday!\" peaked below #1 on the German charts is uncertain based on the provided premises.\n\nANSWER: Uncertain", "Let's analyze the premises and the conclusion step by step.\n\n**Premises:**\n1. Boney M. had several German #1 singles.\n2. \"Hooray! Hooray! It's a Holi-Holiday!\" was a big hit all over Europe.\n3. \"Hooray! Hooray! It's a Holi-Holiday!\" was not in German #1 singles.\n4. A song that peaks below #1 on the German charts is also a song that is not the #1 single in Germany.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\"Hooray! Hooray!

Therefore, according to the second premise, seven is larger than six.\n    - Eight equals seven plus one (\\(8 = 7 + 1\\)). Therefore, eight is larger than seven.\n    - Two is positive. If a number is positive, its double is also positive.\n    - Eight is the double of four (\\(8 = 2 \\times 4\\)).\n    - Four is the double of two (\\(4 = 2 \\times 2\\)).\n\n2. **Evaluation**:\n    - According to the premise \\(7 = 6 + 1\\), we can conclude that seven is larger than six (\\(7 > 6\\)).\n    - The statement we need to evaluate claims that six is larger than seven (\\(6 > 7\\)). This directly contradicts the derived fact (\\(7 > 6\\)).\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, the conclusion that six is larger than seven is false.\n\nANSWER: False", "Let's think step by step.\n\nWe need to evaluate whether the conclusion \"six is larger than seven\" follows from the premises.\n\n1. The first premise tells us that six, seven, and eight are real numbers.\n2. The second premise says that if a real number \\(a\\) equals another real number \\(b\\) plus one, then \\(a\\) is larger than \\(b\\).\n3. The third premise states that if \\(x\\) is larger than \\(y\\), then \\(y\\) is not larger than \\(x\\).\n4. The fourth premise states that seven equals six plus one. According to the second premise, this means seven is larger than six.\n5. The fifth premise states that eight equals seven plus one. Similarly, this means eight is larger than seven.\n6. The next premises discuss properties of the number two and four, stating that two is positive, if a number is positive, its double is also positive, and that eight is the double of four and four is the double of two. These statements do not affect our comparison between six and seven directly.\n  \nFrom premises 4 and 5, we know:\n- Seven is larger than six.\n- Eight is larger than seven.\n\nGiven the transitive property of \"larger than,\" if seven is larger than six, then six is not larger than seven.

According to premise 4, if software is paid, it cannot be under the GNU General Public License. Since TOra is under the GNU General Public License, it cannot be paid software.\n\nGiven these premises, we can conclude that if TOra is under the GNU General Public License and cannot be paid software, it must be free software.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion that \"TOra is a free software\" follows logically from the premises.\n\n**ANSWER: True**", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if TOra is free software.\n\n1. **TOra is a GUI**:\n   - Given premise.\n\n2. **GUIs are software**:\n   - Given premise, so TOra is software.\n\n3. **Software can be free or paid**:\n   - Given premise, indicating the possible types of software.\n\n4. **Paid Software is not under the GNU General Public License**:\n   - Given premise, which implies that any software under the GNU General Public License cannot be paid software.\n\n5. **TOra is under the GNU General Public License**:\n   - Given premise, which implies that TOra cannot be paid software because it is under the GNU General Public License.\n\nSince TOra is under the GNU General Public License, it cannot be paid software, and thus it must be free software based on the premises provided.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion that TOra is free software is supported by the premises.\n\nANSWER: True", "Let's think step by step.\n\nWe need to evaluate whether TOra is free software based on the given premises:\n\n1. TOra is a GUI.\n2. GUIs are software.\n3. Software can be either free or paid.\n4. Paid software is not under the GNU General Public License.\n5. TOra is under the GNU General Public License.\n\nFrom these premises:\n- Premise 1 establishes that TOra is a GUI.\n- Premise 2 implies that since TOra is a GUI, it is software.\n- Premise 4 tells us that any software that is paid is not under the GNU General Public License.\n- Premise 5 confirms that TOra is under the GNU General Public License.\n\nGiven that TOra is under the GNU General Public License and paid software cannot be under this license, it follows that TOra cannot be paid.

The logical rule states that if place A is located in place B and place B is located in place C, then place A is located in place C.\n\nFrom premise 1, Ainderby Quernhow is a village. From premises 2 and 3, we know that the Hambleton District (where Ainderby Quernhow is located) is in North Yorkshire, which itself is in England. Applying the rule from premise 4, since Ainderby Quernhow is in the Hambleton District, and the Hambleton District is in North Yorkshire, and North Yorkshire is in England, it logically follows that Ainderby Quernhow is in England.\n\nTherefore, since Ainderby Quernhow is a village in England, the conclusion that \"there is a village in England\" is true.\n\nANSWER: True", "Let's think step by step.

The second premise tells us that if two soccer teams score the same number of goals in both regular time and extra time, they need to play a penalty shoot-out.\n3. The third premise specifies that Real Madrid and Atl\u00e9tico Madrid both scored one goal in the 2016 UCL final during regular time.\n4. The fourth premise specifies that both teams scored zero goals during the extra time of the same match.\n\nGiven these premises:\n- Both teams scored the same number of goals (one each) in regular time, so they went into extra time according to premise 1.\n- Both teams scored the same number of goals (zero each) in extra time, so they should go to a penalty shoot-out according to premise 2.\n\nTherefore, based on the premises, Real Madrid and Atl\u00e9tico Madrid did need to play a penalty shoot-out in the 2016 UCL final.\n\nANSWER: True", "Let's think step by step.

This means they needed to go to extra time according to premise 1.\n\nPremise 4 states that Real Madrid and Atl\u00e9tico Madrid both scored zero goals in the 2016 UCL final during the extra time. This implies that the match was still tied after extra time because neither team scored additional goals.\n\nBased on premise 2, if the match is still tied after extra time, the next step would be to play a penalty shoot-out.\n\nTherefore, since Real Madrid and Atl\u00e9tico Madrid did not score any goals during the extra time and were already tied at one goal each after the regular time, they needed to play a penalty shoot-out in the 2016 UCL final.\n\nANSWER: True", "Let's think step by step.\n\nWe want to evaluate whether Real Madrid and Atl\u00e9tico Madrid needed to play a penalty shoot-out in the 2016 UCL final based on the given premises.\n\n1.

The problem involves evaluating whether Real Madrid and Atl\u00e9tico Madrid needed to play a penalty shootout in the 2016 UCL final based on the given premises.\n\n1. **Premise Interpretation**:\n   - If two soccer teams score the same number of goals in the regular time of a UCL final, they need to play extra time.\n   - If they still score the same number of goals in extra time, they need to go to a penalty shootout.\n   - Both Real Madrid and Atl\u00e9tico Madrid scored one goal in the regular time of the 2016 UCL final.\n   - Both teams scored zero goals in the extra time of the 2016 UCL final.\n\n2. **Step-by-Step Evaluation**:\n   - Since both teams scored the same number of goals (one goal) during regular time, they went into extra time.\n   - During extra time, both teams scored zero goals, meaning the total goals remained equal (both teams ended up with one goal each).\n\nGiven these conditions, because the total number of goals was equal after both regular time and extra time, the teams would indeed need to proceed to a penalty shootout.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion that \"Real Madrid and Atl\u00e9tico Madrid did not need to play a penalty shoot-out in the 2016 UCL final\" is incorrect.\n\n**ANSWER: False**", "Let's think step by step.\n\n1. **Premise Analysis**:\n    - According to the first premise, if two teams score the same number of goals during regular time in a UCL final, they will play extra time.\n    - The second premise states that if they still score the same number of goals during extra time, they proceed to a penalty shoot-out.\n    - The third premise indicates that Real Madrid and Atl\u00e9tico Madrid both scored one goal during regular time in the 2016 UCL final.\n    - The fourth premise indicates that both teams scored zero goals during extra time in the 2016 UCL final.\n\n2. **Conclusion Evaluation**:\n    - Since Real Madrid and Atl\u00e9tico Madrid scored the same number of goals (one goal each) during regular time, according to the first premise, they needed to play extra time.\n    - During extra time, both teams scored zero goals each. Thus, they would have needed to proceed to a penalty shoot-out according to the second premise.\n\n3. **Final Step**:\n    - The conclusion states that Real Madrid and Atl\u00e9tico Madrid did not need to play a penalty shoot-out in the 2016 UCL final.\n    - Given the analysis above, this conclusion contradicts the information provided by the premises.\n\n**ANSWER**: False", "Let's think step by step to evaluate if Real Madrid and Atl\u00e9tico Madrid did not need to play a penalty shoot-out in the 2016 UCL final.\n\nFrom the premises, we know:\n\n1. **Premise 1:** If two soccer teams score the same number of goals in one UCL final during regular time, they need to play extra time.\n   - **Interpretation:** Since Real Madrid and Atl\u00e9tico Madrid both scored one goal during the regular time, they needed to play extra time according to this rule.\n\n2. **Premise 2:** If two soccer teams score the same number of goals in one UCL final during both regular and extra time, they need to play a penalty shoot-out.\n   - **Interpretation:** Since both teams scored the same number of goals (one in regular time, zero in extra time), based on this premise, they should go to a penalty shoot-out.\n\n3. **Premise 3:** Real Madrid and Atl\u00e9tico Madrid both scored one goal in the 2016 UCL final during the regular time.\n   - **Interpretation:** This confirms they scored the same number of goals during regular time.\n\n4. **Premise 4:** Real Madrid and Atl\u00e9tico Madrid both scored zero goals in the 2016 UCL final during the extra time.\n   - **Interpretation:** They also scored the same number of goals during the extra time.\n\nBased on these premises, the conclusion would be that Real Madrid and Atl\u00e9tico Madrid had the same scores in both regular and extra time, meaning they needed to proceed to a penalty shoot-out according to Premise 2.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion that \"Real Madrid and Atl\u00e9tico Madrid did not need to play a penalty shoot-out in the 2016 UCL final\" is false.\n\n**ANSWER:** False", "Let's think step by step.\n\nWe want to evaluate whether Real Madrid and Atl\u00e9tico Madrid needed to play a penalty shootout in the 2016 UCL final.\n\nFrom Premise 1, we know that if two soccer teams score the same number of goals in one UCL final during the regular time, they need to play for extra time. \n\nFrom Premise 2, we know that if two soccer teams score the same number of goals in one UCL final during both regular and extra time, they need to play the penalty shootout.\n\nPremise 3 states that Real Madrid and Atl\u00e9tico Madrid both scored one goal in the 2016 UCL final during the regular time. Based on Premise 1, this means they proceeded to extra time.\n\nPremise 4 states that Real Madrid and Atl\u00e9tico Madrid both scored zero goals in the 2016 UCL final during the extra time. This means that they still had the same total number of goals after extra time (both had 1 goal). According to Premise 2, if two teams still have the same number of goals after extra time, they proceed to a penalty shootout.\n\nTherefore, based on these premises, Real Madrid and Atl\u00e9tico Madrid did indeed need to play a penalty shootout in the 2016 UCL final.\n\nANSWER: False", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate whether Real Madrid and Atl\u00e9tico Madrid needed to play a penalty shoot-out in the 2016 UCL final.\n\nFirst, we know that if two soccer teams score the same number of goals in one UCL final during regular time, they need to play extra time. According to premise 3, Real Madrid and Atl\u00e9tico Madrid both scored one goal in the 2016 UCL final during regular time. Thus, they entered into extra time.\n\nSecond, if two soccer teams score the same number of goals in one UCL final during both regular and extra time, they need to play the penalty shoot-out. Premise 4 tells us that both teams scored zero goals in the 2016 UCL final during extra time. This means that the total scores after both regular and extra time were still tied.\n\nSince the scores were tied after both regular and extra time, according to premise 2, they would need to proceed to the penalty shoot-out.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion stating that Real Madrid and Atl\u00e9tico Madrid did not need to play a penalty shoot-out in the 2016 UCL final is false.\n\nANSWER: False", "Let's think step by step to evaluate if the conclusion follows from the premises.\n\nFrom the premises:\n1. If two soccer teams score the same number of goals in one UCL final during regular time, they need to play extra time.\n2. If two soccer teams score the same number of goals in one UCL final during both regular and extra time, they need to play a penalty shoot-out.\n3. Real Madrid and Atl\u00e9tico Madrid both scored one goal in the 2016 UCL final during the regular time.\n4. Real Madrid and Atl\u00e9tico Madrid both scored zero goals in the 2016 UCL final during the extra time.\n\nBased on premise 3, Real Madrid and Atl\u00e9tico Madrid scored the same number of goals (one goal each) during the regular time, hence they needed to go into extra time according to premise 1. \n\nPremise 4 states that both teams scored zero goals in the extra time, meaning they still had an equal score (one goal each from regular time). According to premise 2, when two teams have the same score after both regular and extra time, they need to play a penalty shoot-out. \n\nTherefore, Real Madrid and Atl\u00e9tico Madrid did indeed need to play a penalty shoot-out in the 2016 UCL final.

This directly contradicts the conclusion, which states that some humans are horses.\n\n### Conclusion Evaluation:\nGiven that no humans have hooves and all horses do, the claim that \"some humans are horses\" is impossible according to the premises.

The second premise tells us that no human possesses hooves. \n\nGiven these two statements, we can infer that no human can be a horse because any entity that is a horse must have hooves, and no human has hooves.

No humans have hooves.\n\nBased on these statements, if something is a horse, it must have hooves. Conversely, if something does not have hooves, it cannot be a horse. Since no humans have hooves, it follows that no humans can be horses. Therefore, the conclusion \"some humans are horses\" directly contradicts the given premises.\n\nANSWER: False", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate the statement \"Some humans are horses.\"\n\nFrom the premises, we understand the following:\n1. All horses have hooves.\n2. No humans have hooves.\n\nThese statements establish a clear distinction between horses and humans based on the presence or absence of hooves. Specifically, because no humans have hooves, and all horses do have hooves, it follows that there is no overlap between humans and horses. Thus, no human can be a horse, and consequently, some humans being horses is impossible.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"Some humans are horses\" does not follow from the premises.\n\nANSWER: False", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if some humans are horses.\n\nFrom the premises:\n1. All horses have hooves.\n2. No humans have hooves.\n\nWe need to consider the logical implications of these statements:\n\n- Premise 1 tells us that if something is a horse, it necessarily has hooves.\n- Premise 2 tells us that if something is a human, it definitely does not have hooves.\n\nTherefore, since no humans have hooves and all horses must have hooves, it follows logically that no human can be a horse. If some humans were horses, those humans would have to have hooves, which contradicts Premise 2.\n\nThus, the conclusion \"some humans are horses\" is false based on the premises provided.\nANSWER: False", "Let's think step by step.

The conclusion we are evaluating is whether Grebes are not mammals.\n\nFrom the premises, we know:\n1. The only types of mammals that lay eggs are platypuses or echidnas.\n2. Platypuses and echidnas are not hyraxes.\n3. No mammals are invertebrates, and all animals are either vertebrates or invertebrates.\n4. Mammals are animals, and hyraxes are mammals.\n5. Grebes lay eggs but are not platypuses or echidnas.\n\nGiven these points, let's analyze:\n\n- Since grebes lay eggs but are not platypuses or echidnas, they cannot belong to the mammal class based on premise 1.\n- Premise 4 tells us that mammals are animals, and since grebes lay eggs and are not classified as the egg-laying mammals (platypuses or echidnas), they cannot be mammals.\n- Furthermore, grebes laying eggs does not contradict any rules about mammals or invertebrates because non-mammal animals can also lay eggs.\n\nTherefore, since grebes do not fit the definition of the only mammals that lay eggs (which are platypuses and echidnas), and all mammals are animals defined by specific characteristics that grebes do not exhibit, it logically follows that grebes are not mammals.\n\nANSWER: True", "Let's think step by step to evaluate the conclusion \"Grebes are not mammals.\"\n\n1. **From the first premise:** The only types of mammals that lay eggs are either platypuses or echidnas. This tells us that among mammals, only platypuses and echidnas have the ability to lay eggs.\n\n2. **From the second and third premises:** Platypuses are not hyrax, and echidnas are not hyrax. These statements reinforce that platypuses and echidnas belong to distinct categories apart from hyrax.\n\n3. **From the fourth premise:** No mammals are invertebrates. This reinforces the classification of mammals as vertebrates exclusively.\n\n4. **From the fifth premise:** All animals are either vertebrates or invertebrates. This provides a clear dichotomy for all animal classifications.\n\n5. **From the sixth premise:** Mammals are animals. This confirms that mammals fall under the broader category of animals.\n\n6. **From the seventh premise:** Hyraxes are mammals. This places hyraxes specifically within the mammal category.\n\n7. **From the eighth premise:** Grebes lay eggs. This indicates that grebes possess the characteristic of egg-laying, which is common among birds and certain mammals (specifically platypuses and echidnas).\n\n8. **From the ninth premise:** Grebes are not platypuses and also not echidnas. Given that these are the only mammals known to lay eggs, grebes, by this exclusion, cannot be mammals.\n\nBased on the above analysis, since grebes lay eggs but are explicitly stated not to be platypuses or echidnas, and given that no other mammals lay eggs according to the premises, we can conclude that:\n\n**ANSWER: True**\n\nThis is because the premises clearly establish that if an egg-laying animal is not a platypus or echidna, it cannot be classified as a mammal. Therefore, grebes, which lay eggs and are not platypuses or echidnas, cannot be classified as mammals.", "Let's think step by step.\n\nWe need to evaluate if grebes are not mammals based on the given premises. \n\n1.

All animals are either vertebrates or invertebrates.\n6. Mammals are animals.\n7. Hyraxes are mammals.\n8. Grebes lay eggs.\n9. Grebes are not platypuses and also not echidnas.\n\nFrom point 1, we understand that if any mammal lays eggs, it must be either a platypus or an echidna. Given that grebes lay eggs (point 8) but are specified not to be platypuses or echidnas (point 9), grebes laying eggs cannot be explained by being mammals. \n\nAdditionally, point 5 tells us that grebes must be either vertebrates or invertebrates. Since mammals are specified as vertebrates and not invertebrates (point 4), and grebes are not classified as platypuses or echidnas, they do not fall under the category of egg-laying mammals. Hence, they must be non-mammalian vertebrates.\n\nGiven all this reasoning, it is consistent to conclude that grebes are not mammals.\n\n**ANSWER:** True", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if Grebes are not mammals.\n\n1. The only types of mammals that lay eggs are either platypuses or echidnas.\n2. Platypuses are not hyrax, and echidnas are not hyrax.

No mammals are invertebrates, and all animals are either vertebrates or invertebrates.\n4. Mammals are animals, and hyraxes are mammals.\n5. Grebes lay eggs but are not platypuses and also not echidnas.\n\nFrom premise 1, we know that among mammals, only platypuses and echidnas lay eggs. Since grebes lay eggs, but they are explicitly stated not to be platypuses or echidnas, they cannot be classified as the mammals that lay eggs.\n\nPremise 3 states that no mammals are invertebrates, and all animals are either vertebrates or invertebrates. Since Grebes are animals (as all animals are vertebrates or invertebrates), and they are not classified as mammals (based on the egg-laying condition), it implies that Grebes must fall under another category of animals, which would be non-mammalian vertebrates.\n\nTherefore, based on these premises, Grebes are not mammals.\nANSWER: True", "Let's think step by step.\n\nWe want to evaluate if Grebes are not mammals.\n\nFrom the premises:\n- The only types of mammals that lay eggs are either platypuses or echidnas.\n- Platypuses are not hyrax.\n- Echidnas are not hyrax.\n- No mammals are invertebrates.\n- All animals are either vertebrates or invertebrates.\n- Mammals are animals.\n- Hyraxes are mammals.\n- Grebes lay eggs.\n- Grebes are not platypuses and also not echidnas.\n\nWe need to determine if Grebes are mammals based on these premises.

Additionally, the premise that all animals are either vertebrates or invertebrates and that no mammals are invertebrates, supports that grebes, being egg-laying but not fitting the mammalian egg-laying criteria, must fall into a different category of animals, i.e., they are vertebrates but not mammals.\n\nTherefore, based on the premises provided, the statement that grebes are not mammals is supported.\n\nANSWER: True", "Let's think step by step.

Therefore, $\\neg \\text{TalentRequired}(a)$ allows $\\neg \\text{PracticeRequired}(a)$ to be true without contradiction.\n\nHence, it follows from the premises that there can indeed exist art pieces that do not require practice.\n\n**ANSWER: True**", "Let's think step by step.\n\nWe need to evaluate whether the conclusion \"There exist art pieces that do not require practice\" logically follows from the premises provided.\n\n1. **Premise Analysis**:\n   - Not all art pieces require talent.\n     - Symbolically: \\( \\exists x (\\text{ArtPiece}(x) \\land \\neg \\text{TalentRequired}(x)) \\)\n   - Everything that requires talent requires practice.\n     - Symbolically: \\( \\forall y (\\text{TalentRequired}(y) \\rightarrow \\text{PracticeRequired}(y)) \\)\n\n2. **Conclusion to Evaluate**:\n   - There exist art pieces that do not require practice.\n     - Symbolically: \\( \\exists z (\\text{ArtPiece}(z) \\land \\neg \\text{PracticeRequired}(z)) \\)\n\n3. **Logical Evaluation**:\n   - The first premise tells us that there are some art pieces that do not require talent.\n     - This implies there exists at least one art piece \\( x \\) such that \\( \\text{ArtPiece}(x) \\) and \\( \\neg \\text{TalentRequired}(x) \\).\n   - The second premise says that anything requiring talent also requires practice.\n     - This is a universal statement, meaning for any entity \\( y \\), if it requires talent, it requires practice.\n     - Mathematically, if \\( \\text{TalentRequired}(y) \\) then \\( \\text{PracticeRequired}(y) \\).\n\n4. **Connecting the Premises**:\n   - From the first premise, we know there exists an art piece \\( x \\) that does not require talent.\n   - Since \\( x \\) does not require talent, it bypasses the second premise directly. The second premise only applies when talent is required, so it doesn't affect the practice requirement for those art pieces that don't need talent.\n   - Hence, it's possible that \\( x \\), an art piece that does not require talent, might also not require practice.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises because the existence of an art piece that does not require talent indirectly leads to the possibility that this art piece does not require practice as well.\n\n**ANSWER: True**", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if there exist art pieces that do not require practice.\n\n1. From the first premise, we know that not all art pieces require talent. This means there are some art pieces that do not require talent.\n2. The second premise tells us that everything that requires talent also requires practice. This implies that any art piece requiring talent would also require practice.\n3. Combining these two premises, since there are some art pieces that do not require talent, and only those that require talent need practice, it logically follows that there exist art pieces that do not require practice.\n\nThus, based on the premises provided, we can conclude that the statement is true.\n\nANSWER: True", "Let's translate the premises and conclusion into FOL expressions and then evaluate the conclusion based on these premises.\n\n**Premises in FOL:**\n\n1.

From the second premise, we learn that The Mona Lisa is specifically a portrait.\n\nGiven these facts, we see a direct contradiction with the conclusion that \"no world's best-known artworks are portraits.\" The Mona Lisa is both a world's best-known artwork and a portrait, which means at least one world's best-known artwork is indeed a portrait.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is false.\n\nANSWER: False", "Let's think step by step.

We want to evaluate if the conclusion \"No fears lead to terror\" follows from the premises.\n\nFrom premise 1, we understand that some fears lead to anxiety. This means there is at least one instance where fear causes anxiety, but it does not cover all cases of fear.\n\nFrom premise 2, we understand that some anxiety leads to terror. This means there is at least one instance where anxiety escalates to terror, but again, this does not cover all cases of anxiety.\n\nGiven these two premises, there is a possibility that some fears might eventually lead to terror through the intermediate stage of anxiety. However, the premises do not specify the extent or the exact relationships between fear, anxiety, and terror. They only indicate that there are cases where such transitions happen.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion that \"no fears lead to terror\" is inconsistent with the premises because the premises allow for the possibility that some fears might lead to terror through anxiety. Since we have premises indicating possible chains of events from fear to terror, stating that no fears lead to terror contradicts this potential pathway.\n\nANSWER: False", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if the conclusion \"No fears lead to terror\" follows from the premises provided.\n\nPremise 1: Some fears lead to anxiety.\nThis premise tells us that there is at least one fear that results in anxiety.\n\nPremise 2: Some anxiety leads to terror.\nThis premise tells us that there is at least one instance of anxiety resulting in terror.\n\nGiven these premises, it is possible that a fear could indirectly lead to terror via anxiety. Since some fears lead to anxiety (Premise 1) and some anxiety leads to terror (Premise 2), there could be a chain where certain fears lead to anxiety which in turn leads to terror. Thus, the conclusion that \"No fears lead to terror\" contradicts the possible scenarios described by the premises.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"No fears lead to terror\" does not follow from the premises. The correct evaluation would be:\n\nANSWER: False", "Let's think step by step.\n\nWe need to evaluate whether the conclusion \"No fears lead to terror\" follows from the given premises:\n\n1. Some fears lead to anxiety.\n2. Some anxiety leads to terror.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s break down what these premises mean:\n- Premise 1 indicates that there is a subset of fears that result in anxiety.\n- Premise 2 indicates that there is a subset of anxiety that results in terror.\n\nHowever, there is no direct information about the relationship between fears and terror. The premises only link fears to anxiety and anxiety to terror, but they do not explicitly state that fears cannot lead to terror.\n\nTo conclude that no fears lead to terror would require additional information that directly states that fears never result in terror. Given the premises, we know that some fears can lead to anxiety and that some anxieties can lead to terror, but this does not exclude the possibility that certain fears might ultimately lead to terror through anxiety.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, it is not possible to definitively conclude that no fears lead to terror. The premises allow for the possibility that some fears could potentially lead to terror through anxiety.\n\nANSWER: False", "Let's think step by step.\n\nWe need to evaluate if the conclusion \"No fears lead to terror\" follows from the premises.\n\nPremises:\n1. Some fears lead to anxiety.\n2. Some anxiety leads to terror.\n\nFrom the first premise, we know that some subset of fears result in anxiety. The second premise tells us that some subset of anxiety results in terror. However, it's important to note that the use of \"some\" does not specify the extent or the exclusivity of these subsets. \n\nGiven these statements, we can infer that there exists at least one pathway through which fears can indirectly lead to terror via anxiety. For example, if fear A leads to anxiety B, and anxiety B leads to terror C, then fear A leads to terror C indirectly. This direct inference contradicts the conclusion \"No fears lead to terror.\"\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"No fears lead to terror\" does not logically follow from the premises because it's possible, based on the premises, for some fears to eventually lead to terror.\n\n**ANSWER: False**\n\nThis conclusion does not hold true because the premises allow for the possibility that some fears could lead to terror, even if only indirectly through anxiety.", "Let's think step by step.\n\nWe want to evaluate the statement \"No fears lead to terror.\"\n\nFrom premise 1, we know that some fears lead to anxiety. From premise 2, we know that some anxiety leads to terror. These statements suggest that there might be a chain of events where fears lead to anxiety, which in turn can lead to terror. However, these statements use \"some,\" indicating that not all fears lead to anxiety and not all anxieties lead to terror.\n\nGiven that there is a possibility that some fears could eventually lead to terror through anxiety, we cannot conclude that no fears lead to terror. Therefore, the conclusion contradicts the possible scenarios presented by the premises.\n\nANSWER: False", "Let's translate the premises and the conclusion into FOL expressions first.\n\n**Premises:**\n1. Some fears lead to anxiety.\n   - \u2203x (Fear(x) \u2227 LeadsTo(x, Anxiety))\n\n2. Some anxiety leads to terror.\n   - \u2203y (Anxiety(y) \u2227 LeadsTo(y, Terror))\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- No fears lead to terror.\n   - \u2200z (Fear(z) \u2192 \u00acLeadsTo(z, Terror))\n\nNow let's evaluate the conclusion based on the premises:\n\nFrom the first premise, we know that there exists at least one fear that leads to anxiety. From the second premise, we know that there exists some instance of anxiety leading to terror. However, these statements only indicate the existence of such cases without specifying any direct causal chain between fears and terror through anxiety.\n\nSince the first premise only states that some fears lead to anxiety, and the second premise states that some anxieties lead to terror, it is possible for some fears to eventually lead to terror indirectly via anxiety, even though it is not stated explicitly. However, the premises do not provide enough information to definitively conclude that every fear leads to terror or that no fears lead to terror.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"No fears lead to terror\" cannot be directly inferred from the premises. The premises allow for the possibility that fears might lead to terror, but they do not exclude it.\n\n**Answer:**\n- Uncertain\n\nThis is because the premises do not provide sufficient information to confirm or deny the conclusion that no fears lead to terror.", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if no fears lead to terror based on the provided premises.\n\nFrom the premises:\n1. Some fears lead to anxiety.\n2. Some anxiety leads to terror.\n\nWe need to determine if these premises support the conclusion that no fears lead to terror.\n\nGiven premise 1, some fears lead to anxiety, but it doesn't specify how many or which ones. It's possible that some of those same fears might subsequently lead to terror through the intermediate state of anxiety, as indicated by premise 2. The premises allow for a chain reaction where fears can indirectly lead to terror via anxiety.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion that no fears lead to terror contradicts the logical possibility suggested by the premises. There is no direct contradiction in the premises that would support the idea that fears cannot lead to terror at all.\n\nANSWER: False", "Let's think step by step.\n\nWe want to evaluate if the conclusion \"No fears lead to terror\" follows from the premises.\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Some fears lead to anxiety.\n   - This indicates that there exists at least one fear that causes anxiety.\n\n2. **Premise 2**: Some anxiety leads to terror.\n   - This suggests that there exists at least one instance of anxiety that results in terror.\n\nFrom these two premises, we can infer that:\n- There might be a chain of events where some fears cause anxiety, and that anxiety subsequently leads to terror.\n\nTherefore, while the premises don't explicitly state that all fears lead directly to terror, they imply that there is at least one path where fears can indirectly lead to terror through anxiety.\n\nGiven this analysis, the conclusion \"No fears lead to terror\" contradicts the possible chain of events implied by the premises. The premises allow for the possibility that fears can lead to terror through anxiety.\n\nThus, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.\n\n**ANSWER: False**"], "answers": ["False", "False", "False", "False", "False", "False", "False", "Error", "False", "False"], "reference": "Uncertain", "time_total": 88.23379969596863, "time_llm": 88.23316359519958, "prompt_length": 8213}

The premises only state that surprises can be either fun or dreadful, without specifying which category each surprise falls into individually.\n\nTherefore, based on the information given, we cannot definitively conclude that all scares are fun, as they could also be dreadful.\n\nANSWER: False\n\nThe evaluation shows that the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises because the premises allow for the possibility that some scares could be dreadful, not just fun.", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if all scares are fun.\n\nFrom the premises, we have:\n1. Surprises are either fun or dreadful.\n2. All scares are surprises.\n\nGiven these premises:\n- Any scare falls under the category of surprise because of premise 2.\n- Since all surprises are either fun or dreadful, and all scares are surprises, it follows that scares must also be either fun or dreadful.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude that all scares are fun, as it's possible for some scares to be dreadful as well. The conclusion \"all scares are fun\" is too strong based on the given premises. Hence, the statement is false.\n\nANSWER: False", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if all scares are fun.\n\n1. According to the premises, all scares are surprises. So, any scare falls under the category of surprise.\n2. Surprises are either fun or dreadful, which means every surprise must be classified as either fun or dreadful (or potentially both, depending on the interpretation).\n\nSince scares are surprises, and all surprises are either fun or dreadful, it does not necessarily follow that all scares must be fun. A scare could also be dreadful. Therefore, the conclusion that all scares are fun does not logically follow from the given premises.\n\nANSWER: False", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if all scares are fun.\n\nFrom the premises, we know:\n1. All scares are surprises.\n2. Surprises are either fun or dreadful.\n\nGiven these, we understand that any scare, being a type of surprise, must fall into one of the two categories: fun or dreadful. However, the premises do not specify which category a scare falls into; it could be either fun or dreadful. \n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude that all scares are fun because some scares might be dreadful instead.\n\nANSWER: False", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if the conclusion \"All scares are fun\" follows from the given premises.\n\n1. The first premise states that \"Surprises are either fun or dreadful.\" This tells us that every surprise falls into one of these two categories\u2014either it is fun or it is dreadful, but it cannot be both at the same time.\n   \n2. The second premise states that \"All scares are surprises.\" This indicates that every scare is also categorized as a surprise.\n\nFrom the second premise, we know that if something is a scare, it must be a surprise. According to the first premise, since all scares are surprises and all surprises are either fun or dreadful, every scare must therefore be either fun or dreadful.\n\nHowever, the first premise does not specify which type (fun or dreadful) each individual surprise is, only that it must fall into one of these two categories. Thus, while all scares are indeed surprises, it does not follow that all scares must necessarily be fun; they could also be dreadful.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"All scares are fun\" cannot be directly derived from the premises provided.\n\nANSWER: False", "Let's think step by step. The goal is to evaluate if the conclusion \"All scares are fun\" follows from the premises.\n\nFirst, we know from the premises that:\n1. Surprises are either fun or dreadful.\n2. All scares are surprises.\n\nSince all scares are a subset of surprises (Premise 2), and all surprises are either fun or dreadful (Premise 1), it follows that all scares must also be either fun or dreadful. However, the conclusion claims that all scares are fun, which is not necessarily true because scares could also be dreadful based on the premises.\n\nThus, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises because while it's possible that some scares might be fun, there is also the possibility that some scares might be dreadful.\n\n**Answer:** False", "Let's think step by step.\n\nWe have two premises:\n1. Surprises are either fun or dreadful.\n2. All scares are surprises.\n\nAnd the conclusion we need to evaluate is:\n- All scares are fun.\n\nFrom the second premise, we know that any scare falls under the category of surprise. According to the first premise, surprises can only be categorized as either fun or dreadful. This means that every scare, being a type of surprise, must also be categorized as either fun or dreadful.\n\nHowever, the first premise does not specify that surprises are always fun; they can also be dreadful. Therefore, just because a scare is a surprise does not mean it must be fun\u2014it could also be dreadful.\n\nSince there is a possibility that scares could be dreadful rather than fun, we cannot conclude that all scares are fun.\n\nANSWER: False", "Let's think step by step. The premises and conclusion provided need to be analyzed carefully.\n\nFrom the premises, we have:\n1. Surprises are either fun or dreadful.\n2. All scares are surprises.\n\nWe need to evaluate whether the conclusion \"All scares are fun\" logically follows from these premises.\n\nAccording to the first premise, any surprise must fall into one of two categories: fun or dreadful. There are no other possibilities for surprises. \n\nGiven the second premise, every scare is categorized as a surprise. Therefore, since every scare is a surprise, and every surprise is either fun or dreadful, it follows that every scare must be either fun or dreadful.\n\nHowever, the conclusion claims that all scares are fun. This is not necessarily true based on the premises, because according to the premises, a scare can also be dreadful. The premises do not exclude the possibility that some or even all scares might be dreadful.\n\nTherefore, the statement \"All scares are fun\" does not logically follow from the premises.\n\nANSWER: False", "Let's translate the premises and conclusion into FOL expressions and then evaluate the conclusion based on these translations.\n\n### Translation\n\n#### Premises:\n1.

We want to evaluate the statement \"all birds swim.\" Based on the premises provided:\n\n1. A hawk never swims.\n2. Some birds are hawks.\n\nFrom premise 1, we know that at least one type of bird, the hawk, does not swim. From premise 2, we understand that among all birds, some belong to the category of hawks. Given these premises, we can conclude that not all birds swim because we have identified a specific group of birds (hawks) that do not swim.\n\nTherefore, the statement \"all birds swim\" contradicts the premises directly, making it false.\n\nANSWER: False", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if the conclusion \"All birds swim\" follows from the given premises.\n\nFrom the premises:\n1. A hawk never swims.\n2. Some birds are hawks.\n\nConsidering these:\n- Premise 1 tells us that at least one type of bird (hawks) does not swim.\n- Premise 2 confirms that there are some birds that fall under the category of hawks.\n\nTherefore, if some birds (specifically hawks) never swim, it cannot be true that all birds swim because this would contradict the fact that at least one type of bird (hawks) does not swim.\n\nThus, the conclusion that \"All birds swim\" does not follow from the premises and is false.\n\nANSWER: False", "Let's translate each premise and the conclusion into First-Order Logic (FOL) expressions, then evaluate the conclusion based on the premises.\n\n### Premises in FOL\n\n1. **Premise:** All biodegradable things are environment-friendly.\n   - FOL: \u2200x (Biodegradable(x) \u2192 EnvironmentFriendly(x))\n   \n2. **Premise:** All woodware is biodegradable.\n   - FOL: \u2200x (Woodware(x) \u2192 Biodegradable(x))\n   \n3. **Premise:** All paper is woodware.\n   - FOL: \u2200x (Paper(x) \u2192 Woodware(x))\n   \n4. **Premise:** Nothing is a good thing and also a bad thing.\n   - FOL: \u2200x (\u00ac(Good(x) \u2227 Bad(x)))\n   \n5. **Premise:** All environment-friendly things are good.\n   - FOL: \u2200x (EnvironmentFriendly(x) \u2192 Good(x))\n   \n6. **Premise:** A worksheet is either paper or environment-friendly.\n   - FOL: Worksheet(x) \u2192 (Paper(x) \u2228 EnvironmentFriendly(x))\n\n### Conclusion in FOL\n\n7. **Conclusion:** A worksheet is not biodegradable.\n   - FOL: Worksheet(x) \u2192 \u00acBiodegradable(x)\n\n### Evaluation\n\nTo determine whether the conclusion follows from the premises, let's analyze the premises:\n\n- From (3), if a worksheet is paper, it is woodware (since Paper(x) \u2192 Woodware(x)).\n- From (2), if a worksheet is woodware, it is biodegradable (since Woodware(x) \u2192 Biodegradable(x)).\n- Thus, if a worksheet is paper, it is biodegradable.\n\nHowever, from (6), a worksheet is either paper or environment-friendly. If the worksheet is environment-friendly, it might still be biodegradable (because being environment-friendly only implies it is good, but does not negate it from being biodegradable). The premises do not provide information about whether an environment-friendly item is necessarily non-biodegradable.\n\nGiven this, there is no direct contradiction or conclusive evidence from the premises that a worksheet is not biodegradable.

We want to evaluate if the conclusion \"all birds swim\" follows from the premises.\n\nFrom the premises, we know:\n1. A hawk never swims.\n2. Some birds are hawks.\n\nGiven these premises, we know there is at least one bird (a hawk) that does not swim. The second premise tells us that there is some overlap between the category of \"birds\" and the category of \"hawks.\" Thus, since there exists at least one bird that does not swim (the hawk), it cannot be true that all birds swim.\n\nTherefore, the statement \"all birds swim\" is false based on the provided premises.\n\nANSWER: False", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if the conclusion \"All birds swim\" follows from the premises.\n\nFrom the first premise, we know that a hawk never swims. Since some birds are hawks (second premise), we can conclude that at least some birds do not swim. Therefore, it cannot be true that all birds swim, because we have established that at least some birds, specifically hawks, do not swim.\n\nThus, the conclusion \"All birds swim\" contradicts the given premises.\n\nANSWER: False", "Let's think step by step.\n\nWe want to evaluate if the conclusion \"All birds swim\" follows from the premises provided. \n\n1. The first premise states, \"A hawk never swims.\" This tells us that at least some birds (specifically, hawks) do not swim.\n2. The second premise states, \"Some birds are hawks.\" This indicates that within the category of birds, there exists a subset that are hawks.\n\nFrom these premises, we can infer that there are at least some birds that do not swim because hawks never swim, and some birds are hawks. Therefore, it directly contradicts the conclusion \"All birds swim,\" as we've established that at least some birds (hawks) do not swim.\n\nThus, the conclusion does not follow from the premises, and we can confidently say it is false.\n\n**ANSWER:** False", "Let's translate the premises and the conclusion into first-order logic expressions.\n\n### Premises in FOL:\n1.

From premise 6, if Amy is not a Nobel physics laureate, then Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner. Since we assumed \u00acOlympicGoldMedalWinner(Amy), this doesn't help us directly conclude NobelPhysicsLaureate(Amy). Given premise 5, Amy either spends most time on sports or is an Olympic gold medal winner. If \u00acOlympicGoldMedalWinner(Amy), then Amy spends most time on sports, which contradicts premise 3 (if Amy were a full-time scientist).

This means there exists at least one type of bird (the hawk) that does not swim.\n\nFrom Premise 2, we know that some birds are hawks. This indicates that within the category of birds, there are instances of hawks, which based on Premise 1, do not swim.\n\nTherefore, since we have established that hawks do not swim and hawks are a subset of birds, we can conclude that not all birds swim.\n\nThus, the conclusion \"All birds swim\" directly contradicts the given premises. \n\nANSWER: False"], "answers": ["False", "False", "Error", "False", "False", "Error", "False", "False", "Error", "False"], "reference": "False", "time_total": 173.37268781661987, "time_llm": 173.37193632125854, "prompt_length": 8188}

Here are the premises:\n\n1. If something can transport multiple passengers, then it is not a one-seater.\n2. All Tesla Model 3 cars can transport multiple passengers.\n3. All single-seat electric cars are one-seaters.\n4. All Solo EV cars are single-seat electric cars.\n5. If John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, then John's car is not a Tesla Model 3 or a single-seat electric car.\n\nFrom premises 2 and 1, we infer that all Tesla Model 3 cars are not one-seaters because they can transport multiple passengers. Premises 3 and 4 tell us that all Solo EV cars are one-seaters because they are single-seat electric cars. \n\nPremise 5 is a bit tricky. It states that if John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, then it cannot be a Tesla Model 3 or a single-seat electric car. This premise essentially says that if John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, it cannot be any type of one-seater either.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possibilities:\n- If John's car is a Tesla Model 3, it fits the criteria given by the premises.\n- If John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, according to premise 5, it cannot be a one-seater, which includes not being a Solo EV car, thus it must be something else entirely, which we do not have information about from the premises.\n\nGiven these conditions, the only way premise 5 holds true is if John's car is a Tesla Model 3. Any deviation from this would contradict the implications of premise 5.\n\nTherefore, based on the premises, we can conclude that John's car must be a Tesla Model 3.\n\nANSWER: True", "Let's break down the evaluation step by step using the given premises:\n\n1. **Premise Analysis**:\n   - Premise 1: If something can transport multiple passengers, then they are not one-seaters.\n   - Premise 2: All Tesla Model 3 can transport multiple passengers.\n   - Premise 3: All single-seat electric cars are one-seaters.\n   - Premise 4: All Solo EV cars are single-seat electric cars.\n   - Premise 5: If John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, then John's car is not a Tesla Model 3 or a single-seat electric car.\n\n2. **Conclusion**:\n   - The conclusion is \"John's car is a Tesla Model 3.\"\n\n3. **Evaluation**:\n   - From Premise 2, we know that all Tesla Model 3s can transport multiple passengers.\n   - From Premise 1, we can infer that if a vehicle transports multiple passengers, it is not a one-seater.\n   - From Premise 3 and Premise 4, we know that all Solo EV cars are one-seaters because they are single-seat electric cars.\n   \n   Now, let\u2019s look at Premise 5: \n   - If John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, then it is not a Tesla Model 3 or a single-seat electric car. This is a tautology, essentially stating that if John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, it cannot be a Tesla Model 3 (which is inherently true) and also cannot be a single-seat electric car (Solo EV).\n   - This means that if John's car is a single-seat electric car (Solo EV), then John's car must be a Tesla Model 3 because the only option left if it is not a single-seat electric car is that it is a Tesla Model 3.\n\nSince Premise 5 does not provide any direct information about the type of John's car unless we assume the negation, we need to check if it leaves any room for John's car to be something else. Given the logical structure of the premises, we cannot definitively conclude that John's car is a Tesla Model 3 just based on the given information without additional context.\n\nTherefore, the evaluation of the conclusion based solely on the premises provided would be:\n\nANSWER: Uncertain", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate whether John's car is a Tesla Model 3.\n\n1. **Premise Analysis:**\n   - \"If something can transport multiple passengers, then they are not one-seaters.\"\n     - \\( \\forall x [\\text{canTransportMultiplePassengers}(x) \\rightarrow \\neg \\text{oneSeater}(x)] \\)\n   - \"All Tesla Model 3 can transport multiple passengers.\"\n     - \\( \\forall x [\\text{TeslaModel3}(x) \\rightarrow \\text{canTransportMultiplePassengers}(x)] \\)\n   - \"All single-seat electric cars are one-seaters.\"\n     - \\( \\forall x [\\text{singleSeatElectricCar}(x) \\rightarrow \\text{oneSeater}(x)] \\)\n   - \"All Solo EV cars are single-seat electric cars.\"\n     - \\( \\forall x [\\text{SoloEV}(x) \\rightarrow \\text{singleSeatElectricCar}(x)] \\)\n   - \"If John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, then John's car is not a Tesla Model 3 or a single-seat electric car.\"\n     - \\( \\neg \\text{TeslaModel3}(\\text{John'sCar}) \\rightarrow (\\neg \\text{TeslaModel3}(\\text{John'sCar}) \\lor \\neg \\text{singleSeatElectricCar}(\\text{John'sCar})) \\)\n\n2. **Logical Reasoning:**\n   - According to the fifth premise, if John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, then it is either not a Tesla Model 3 or not a single-seat electric car. However, this is always true because it is a tautology (it's always true by definition).\n   - The critical point is that if John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, then we can only conclude that it is not a single-seat electric car. This is because the premise \\( \\neg \\text{TeslaModel3}(\\text{John'sCar}) \\rightarrow (\\neg \\text{TeslaModel3}(\\text{John'sCar}) \\lor \\neg \\text{singleSeatElectricCar}(\\text{John'sCar})) \\) is logically true regardless of whether \\( \\text{singleSeatElectricCar}(\\text{John'sCar}) \\) is true or false.\n   - But, we can't definitively conclude whether John's car is a Tesla Model 3 or not from these premises alone.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided premises, we cannot conclusively determine whether John's car is a Tesla Model 3 or not.\n\n**ANSWER:** Uncertain", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if John's car is a Tesla Model 3.\n\nFrom Premise 2, we know that all Tesla Model 3 can transport multiple passengers. And according to Premise 1, if something can transport multiple passengers, then it is not a one-seater.\n\nPremise 3 states that all single-seat electric cars are one-seaters. And from Premise 4, all Solo EV cars are single-seat electric cars, implying they are one-seaters.\n\nNow, considering Premise 5: If John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, then John's car is not a Tesla Model 3 or a single-seat electric car. This means if John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, it cannot be a single-seat electric car either.\n\nGiven these statements, let's examine the possibilities:\n\n1. If John\u2019s car is a Tesla Model 3:\n   - It can transport multiple passengers (from Premise 2), meaning it is not a one-seater (from Premise 1).\n   - Therefore, it contradicts any assumption that John's car might be a single-seat electric car.\n\n2. If John\u2019s car is not a Tesla Model 3:\n   - Then according to Premise 5, John's car cannot be a single-seat electric car.\n   - Therefore, it cannot be a Solo EV car (since Solo EV cars are single-seat electric cars).\n\nThis leaves us with only one possibility: If John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, it must be some other type of car that doesn't fit the criteria of being a single-seat electric car or a Tesla Model 3.\n\nHowever, the conclusion states that John's car is a Tesla Model 3. We need to confirm if this fits all the premises without contradiction:\n\n- A Tesla Model 3 can transport multiple passengers (Premise 2).\n- Therefore, it is not a one-seater (Premise 1).\n- This aligns with the fact that if John's car were not a Tesla Model 3, it wouldn't be a single-seat electric car (Premise 5).\n\nThus, the only way to satisfy all premises without contradiction is if John's car indeed is a Tesla Model 3.\n\nANSWER: True", "Let's translate the premises and the conclusion into formal first-order logic expressions and then evaluate the conclusion.\n\n### Translation to First-Order Logic:\n\n**Premises:**\n\n1. \\(\\forall x (\\text{TransportMultiplePassengers}(x) \\rightarrow \\neg \\text{OneSeat}(x))\\)\n2. \\(\\forall x (\\text{TeslaModel3}(x) \\rightarrow \\text{TransportMultiplePassengers}(x))\\)\n3. \\(\\forall x (\\text{SingleSeatElectricCar}(x) \\rightarrow \\text{OneSeat}(x))\\)\n4. \\(\\forall x (\\text{SoloEV}(x) \\rightarrow \\text{SingleSeatElectricCar}(x))\\)\n5. \\(\\forall x ((\\neg \\text{TeslaModel3}(x)) \\rightarrow (\\neg \\text{TeslaModel3}(x) \\land \\neg \\text{SingleSeatElectricCar}(x)))\\)\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\\[ \\text{TeslaModel3}(\\text{JohnsCar}) \\]\n\n### Evaluation:\n\nTo determine whether the conclusion follows from the premises, let's analyze each premise carefully:\n\n1. \\( \\forall x (\\text{TransportMultiplePassengers}(x) \\rightarrow \\neg \\text{OneSeat}(x)) \\): If a vehicle can transport multiple passengers, it is not a one-seater.\n2. \\( \\forall x (\\text{TeslaModel3}(x) \\rightarrow \\text{TransportMultiplePassengers}(x)) \\): All Tesla Model 3s can transport multiple passengers.\n3. \\( \\forall x (\\text{SingleSeatElectricCar}(x) \\rightarrow \\text{OneSeat}(x)) \\): All single-seat electric cars are one-seaters.\n4. \\( \\forall x (\\text{SoloEV}(x) \\rightarrow \\text{SingleSeatElectricCar}(x)) \\): All Solo EV cars are single-seat electric cars.\n5. \\( \\forall x ((\\neg \\text{TeslaModel3}(x)) \\rightarrow (\\neg \\text{TeslaModel3}(x) \\land \\neg \\text{SingleSeatElectricCar}(x))) \\): If a car is not a Tesla Model 3, then it is not a Tesla Model 3 and it is not a single-seat electric car.

However, this does not provide any direct information about whether John's car is a Tesla Model 3. \n\nPremises 1 through 4 only give us information about the properties of certain types of vehicles, but do not directly help us determine the type of John's car.\n\nGiven these premises, we cannot definitively conclude that John's car is a Tesla Model 3.

Hence, if \\( T(x) \\), then \\(\\neg O(x)\\).\n- From Premise 3, if something is a single-seat electric car (\\(S(x)\\)), it is a one-seater (\\(O(x)\\)).\n- From Premise 4, if something is a Solo EV car (\\(SEV(x)\\)), it is a single-seat electric car (\\(S(x)\\)), and thus a one-seater (\\(O(x)\\)).\n- From Premise 5, if John's car is not a Tesla Model 3 (\\(\\neg T(J)\\)), then John's car is not a Tesla Model 3 (\\(\\neg T(J)\\)) or not a single-seat electric car (\\(\\neg S(J)\\)). This is always true because it's a tautology (A \\(\\rightarrow\\) A \\(\\vee\\) B).\n\nGiven Premise 5 is a tautology, it doesn't provide new information about the nature of John's car beyond its non-Tesla Model 3 status.\n\nTo conclude \\( T(J) \\):\n- We would need additional premises or information that directly link John's car being a Tesla Model 3.\n\nSince the provided premises do not give enough information to definitively conclude that John's car is a Tesla Model 3, the conclusion is uncertain based on the given premises.\n\n**ANSWER: Uncertain**", "Let's analyze the premises step by step to see if we can conclude that John's car is a Tesla Model 3.\n\n### Premises:\n1. **If something can transport multiple passengers, then they are not one-seaters.**\n   - \\( \\forall x ((\\text{transports\\_multiple\\_passengers}(x) \\rightarrow \\neg \\text{one\\_seater}(x)) \\)\n   \n2. **All Tesla Model 3 can transport multiple passengers.**\n   - \\( \\forall x (\\text{Tesla\\_Model\\_3}(x) \\rightarrow \\text{transports\\_multiple\\_passengers}(x)) \\)\n   \n3. **All single-seat electric cars are one-seaters.**\n   - \\( \\forall x (\\text{single\\_seat\\_electric\\_car}(x) \\rightarrow \\text{one\\_seater}(x)) \\)\n   \n4. **All Solo EV cars are single-seat electric cars.**\n   - \\( \\forall x (\\text{Solo\\_EV}(x) \\rightarrow \\text{single\\_seat\\_electric\\_car}(x)) \\)\n   \n5. **If John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, then John's car is not a Tesla Model 3 or a single-seat electric car.**\n   - \\( \\neg \\text{Tesla\\_Model\\_3}(\\text{John's\\_car}) \\rightarrow (\\neg \\text{Tesla\\_Model\\_3}(\\text{John's\\_car}) \\lor \\neg \\text{single\\_seat\\_electric\\_car}(\\text{John's\\_car})) \\)\n\nThis premise is always true because the right side of the implication will always hold true regardless of the left side due to logical redundancy. \n\n### Conclusion:\n- **John's car is a Tesla Model 3.**\n  - \\( \\text{Tesla\\_Model\\_3}(\\text{John's\\_car}) \\)\n\n### Analysis:\n\nFrom premise 2, we know that if John's car is a Tesla Model 3, it can transport multiple passengers and thus cannot be a one-seater. From premise 1, this is consistent with the rule that something that transports multiple passengers cannot be a one-seater.\n\nHowever, we need to consider the implications if John's car is not a Tesla Model 3. According to premise 5, if John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, it can still be something else that is not a single-seat electric car, but we have no direct information to determine its exact type based solely on the given premises.\n\nPremise 5 essentially states that if John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, it doesn't necessarily provide new information that constrains it further except that it is not a single-seat electric car (which would already follow from it being not a Tesla Model 3).\n\nSince we have no additional premises that constrain John's car type beyond the provided ones, and there is no explicit information indicating that John's car must be a Tesla Model 3, the given premises do not definitively prove that John's car is a Tesla Model 3.\n\n### Final Answer:\n**Uncertain**\n\nGiven the premises, we cannot conclusively determine that John's car is a Tesla Model 3; therefore, the conclusion is uncertain based on the provided information."], "answers": ["True", "Uncertain", "Error", "True", "Error", "True", "Uncertain", "Uncertain", "Uncertain", "Error"], "reference": "Uncertain", "time_total": 219.36126518249512, "time_llm": 219.36056876182556, "prompt_length": 8496}
