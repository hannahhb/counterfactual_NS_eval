If one is true, the other is false. The conclusion's consequent is `(StudentAttendsSchool(Bonnie) OR InactiveDisinterested(Bonnie))`. This consequent is *always true* because Bonnie is either a student who attends school (Case 1) or an inactive/disinterested member of the community (Case 2). She cannot be neither, due to `StudentAttendsSchool(Bonnie)` being True in Case 1 and `InactiveDisinterested(Bonnie)` being True in Case 2, and the fact that `StudentAttendsSchool(Bonnie)` and `InactiveDisinterested(Bonnie)` are mutually exclusive (if `StudentAttendsSchool(B)` is True, `InactiveDisinterested(B)` is False, and vice versa).\n\nLet's re-verify the mutual exclusivity.\nIf `StudentAttendsSchool(B)` is True, then by P6, `AttendsEngaged(B)` is True. By P1, `PerformOften(B)` must be True. By P2, `InactiveDisinterested(B)` must be False.\nIf `InactiveDisinterested(B)` is True, then by P4, `ChaperoneDances(B)` is True. By P3, `NOT StudentAttendsSchool(B)` is True.\nSo indeed, `StudentAttendsSchool(Bonnie)` and `InactiveDisinterested(Bonnie)` are mutually exclusive and exhaustive of the two main cases for Bonnie. This means `(StudentAttendsSchool(Bonnie) OR InactiveDisinterested(Bonnie))` is always true.\n\nSince the consequent of the conclusion `(StudentAttendsSchool(Bonnie) OR InactiveDisinterested(Bonnie))` is always true based on the premises, the implication `A -> B` where B is always true, is itself always true, regardless of A.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion must be True.\n\nLet's double-check the step-by-step reasoning.\n\n1.  **Analyze Premise 6:** `AttendsEngaged(Bonnie) IFF StudentAttendsSchool(Bonnie)`. This is a strong link.\n2.  **Analyze Premise 2:** `PerformOften(Bonnie) XOR InactiveDisinterested(Bonnie)`.

Since `InactiveDisinterested(Bonnie)` is False, `ChaperoneDances(Bonnie)` can be anything (but we derived it must be false if `StudentAttendsSchool(Bonnie)` is true).\n    *   From P3: `ChaperoneDances(Bonnie) -> NOT StudentAttendsSchool(Bonnie)`. Since `StudentAttendsSchool(Bonnie)` is True, `ChaperoneDances(Bonnie)` must be False.\n    *   Summary for Possibility 1: `StudentAttendsSchool(Bonnie)` is True, `InactiveDisinterested(Bonnie)` is False.\n4.  **Explore Possibility 2: `InactiveDisinterested(Bonnie)` is True.**\n    *   From P2: `PerformOften(Bonnie)` is False.\n    *   From P4: `ChaperoneDances(Bonnie)` is True.\n    *   From P3: `StudentAttendsSchool(Bonnie)` is False.\n    *   From P6: `AttendsEngaged(Bonnie)` is False.\n    *   Summary for Possibility 2: `StudentAttendsSchool(Bonnie)` is False, `InactiveDisinterested(Bonnie)` is True.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Consequent of the Conclusion:** `(StudentAttendsSchool(Bonnie) OR InactiveDisinterested(Bonnie))`.\n    *   In Possibility 1: (True OR False) = True.\n    *   In Possibility 2: (False OR True) = True.\n    *   Since these are the only two possibilities for Bonnie, the consequent of the conclusion is always True.\n\n6.  **Evaluate the Conclusion as a whole:** `Antecedent -> True`.\n    *   An implication `A -> B` is True if B is True, regardless of the truth value of A.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nThe premise 5 `YoungChildTeenagerFurtherAcad(x) -> StudentAttendsSchool(x)` and the part about `YoungChildTeenagerFurtherAcad(Bonnie)` in the conclusion's antecedent are irrelevant because the consequent of the conclusion is always true.\n\nFinal check: The reasoning that the consequent is always true seems solid.\n`StudentAttendsSchool(Bonnie)` XOR `InactiveDisinterested(Bonnie)` is true.\nThis is derived from:\n`PerformOften(Bonnie)` XOR `InactiveDisinterested(Bonnie)` (P2)\nIf `PerformOften(Bonnie)`: Then `AttendsEngaged(Bonnie)` (P1).

Thus `StudentAttendsSchool(Bonnie)` is True and `InactiveDisinterested(Bonnie)` is False.\nIf `InactiveDisinterested(Bonnie)`: Then `ChaperoneDances(Bonnie)` (P4). Then `NOT StudentAttendsSchool(Bonnie)` (P3). Thus `StudentAttendsSchool(Bonnie)` is False and `InactiveDisinterested(Bonnie)` is True.\nSo indeed, for Bonnie, exactly one of `StudentAttendsSchool(Bonnie)` or `InactiveDisinterested(Bonnie)` is true. Therefore, `(StudentAttendsSchool(Bonnie) OR InactiveDisinterested(Bonnie))` is always true.\n\nThe conclusion is an implication `X -> Y`.

If `WorksRemotely(James)` is true (due to being in other countries), then the conclusion's consequent becomes: `(HasLunchAtHome(James) \u2227 True) \u2228 (\u00acHasLunchAtHome(James) \u2227 False)`.

It's generally understood that if someone `WorksRemotely(James)`, they do *not* `AppearsInCompany(James)`. Let's re-examine this.\n            *   Premise 1: `SchedulesMeetingWithCustomer(x) \u2192 AppearsInCompany(x)`.\n            *   Premise 5: `InOtherCountries(x) \u2192 WorksRemotely(x)`.\n            *   Premise 4: `HasLunchAtHome(x) \u2192 WorksRemotely(x)`.\n            *   There is no direct premise stating `WorksRemotely(x) \u2192 \u00acAppearsInCompany(x)`. However, the definition of \"working remotely from home\" strongly implies not appearing in the company. If we assume this common-sense implication:\n                *   If `InOtherCountries(James)` is true, then `WorksRemotely(James)` is true.\n                *   If `WorksRemotely(James)` is true, and it implies `\u00acAppearsInCompany(James)`.\n                *   If `\u00acAppearsInCompany(James)` is true, then from (1) `\u00acSchedulesMeetingWithCustomer(James)`.\n                *   If `\u00acSchedulesMeetingWithCustomer(James)` is true, then from (2) `\u00acHasLunchInCompany(James)`.\n                *   If `\u00acHasLunchInCompany(James)` is true, then from (3) `HasLunchAtHome(James)` must be true.\n                *   So, if James is in other countries, then `WorksRemotely(James)` is true and `HasLunchAtHome(James)` is true.\n                *   In this sub-case (`InOtherCountries(James)`), `HasLunchAtHome(James) \u2227 WorksRemotely(James)` is true, which makes the first disjunct of the consequent true.\n                *   Thus, the conclusion holds under the assumption that working remotely implies not appearing in the company.\n\n**Let's re-evaluate without the \"common-sense\" assumption:**\n\nIf `InOtherCountries(James)` is true, then `WorksRemotely(James)` is true (from P5).\nThe conclusion requires `(HasLunchAtHome(James) \u2227 WorksRemotely(James)) \u2228 (\u00acHasLunchAtHome(James) \u2227 \u00acWorksRemotely(James))`.\nSince `WorksRemotely(James)` is true, the second disjunct `(\u00acHasLunchAtHome(James) \u2227 \u00acWorksRemotely(James))` is false.\nSo, the conclusion simplifies to `HasLunchAtHome(James) \u2227 WorksRemotely(James)`. Since we already know `WorksRemotely(James)` is true, this further simplifies to `HasLunchAtHome(James)`.\n\nSo, the question is: If `InOtherCountries(James)` is true, does `HasLunchAtHome(James)` necessarily follow?\n\n*   We know `InOtherCountries(James) \u2192 WorksRemotely(James)` (P5).\n*   We know `HasLunchAtHome(James) \u2192 WorksRemotely(James)` (P4).\n*   We know `HasLunchInCompany(James) \u2228 HasLunchAtHome(James)` (P3).\n\nCan `InOtherCountries(James)` be true AND `HasLunchInCompany(James)` be true?\nIf `HasLunchInCompany(James)` is true:\n*   Then `SchedulesMeetingWithCustomer(James)` (from P2).\n*   Then `AppearsInCompany(James)` (from P1).\n\nSo, if James is in other countries, and has lunch in the company, then James works remotely AND appears in the company. This isn't contradictory based *solely* on the given premises. There is no premise that says `WorksRemotely(x) \u2192 \u00acAppearsInCompany(x)`. It's a very common real-world understanding, but not explicitly stated.\n\nIf `AppearsInCompany(James)` is true and `WorksRemotely(James)` is true, this scenario is not explicitly ruled out by the premises.\nIf this scenario is possible:\n*   `InOtherCountries(James)` is true.\n*   `WorksRemotely(James)` is true (from P5).\n*   `HasLunchInCompany(James)` is true.\n*   `HasLunchAtHome(James)` is false (from P3, as it's \"either...or\").\n\nIn this scenario:\n*   Antecedent: `InOtherCountries(James)` is true.\n*   Consequent: `(HasLunchAtHome(James) \u2227 WorksRemotely(James)) \u2228 (\u00acHasLunchAtHome(James) \u2227 \u00acWorksRemotely(James))`\n    *   This becomes `(False \u2227 True) \u2228 (True \u2227 False)`, which is `False \u2228 False`, which is `False`.\n\nSince we found a scenario (`InOtherCountries(James)` is true, `HasLunchInCompany(James)` is true) where the antecedent is true but the consequent is false, the conclusion is not necessarily true.\n\n**Let's re-check the James's specific premise (P7):**\n` (Manager(James) \u2227 AppearsInCompany(James)) \u2228 (\u00acManager(James) \u2227 \u00acAppearsInCompany(James)) `\n\nThis premise is about James, and it links James's manager status to appearing in the company. It seems designed to create a specific scenario for James.\n\nLet's reconsider the case where `InOtherCountries(James)` is true.\n*   If `InOtherCountries(James)` is true, then `WorksRemotely(James)` is true (P5).\n*   If `WorksRemotely(James)` is true, then (from P6) `\u00acManager(James)` must be true.\n*   Since `\u00acManager(James)` is true, from P7, the second disjunct `(\u00acManager(James) \u2227 \u00acAppearsInCompany(James))` must be true. This means `\u00acAppearsInCompany(James)` is true.\n\nNow we have:\n1.  `InOtherCountries(James)` (assumption for this case)\n2.  `WorksRemotely(James)` (from 1 and P5)\n3.  `\u00acManager(James)` (from 2 and P6)\n4.  `\u00acAppearsInCompany(James)` (from 3 and P7)\n\nNow, let's see if James can `HasLunchInCompany(James)`:\n*   If `HasLunchInCompany(James)`, then `SchedulesMeetingWithCustomer(James)` (P2).\n*   If `SchedulesMeetingWithCustomer(James)`, then `AppearsInCompany(James)` (P1).\n*   But we derived `\u00acAppearsInCompany(James)` (point 4 above).\n*   This is a contradiction. Therefore, `HasLunchInCompany(James)` must be false.\n\nSince `HasLunchInCompany(James)` is false, from P3 (`HasLunchInCompany(James) \u2228 HasLunchAtHome(James)`), it must be that `HasLunchAtHome(James)` is true.\n\nSo, if `InOtherCountries(James)` is true, we have deduced:\n*   `WorksRemotely(James)` (from P5)\n*   `HasLunchAtHome(James)` (derived above)\n\nNow, let's check the conclusion's consequent again for this case:\n` (HasLunchAtHome(James) \u2227 WorksRemotely(James)) \u2228 (\u00acHasLunchAtHome(James) \u2227 \u00acWorksRemotely(James)) `\nSince `HasLunchAtHome(James)` is true and `WorksRemotely(James)` is true, the first disjunct `(HasLunchAtHome(James) \u2227 WorksRemotely(James))` is true.\nTherefore, the consequent is true.\n\n**Conclusion for Case 2 (James is in other countries):** The conclusion holds.\n\n**Final Check:**\n\nThe conclusion is `If (Manager(James) \u2228 InOtherCountries(James)), then ( (HasLunchAtHome(James) \u2227 WorksRemotely(James)) \u2228 (\u00acHasLunchAtHome(James) \u2227 \u00acWorksRemotely(James)) )`\n\nWe analyzed two scenarios for the antecedent being true:\n\n*   **Scenario A: `Manager(James)` is true.**\n    *   From P6: `\u00acWorksRemotely(James)`.\n    *   From P4: If `HasLunchAtHome(James)` then `WorksRemotely(James)`. Since `\u00acWorksRemotely(James)`, it implies `\u00acHasLunchAtHome(James)`.\n    *   So, we have `\u00acHasLunchAtHome(James)` and `\u00acWorksRemotely(James)`.\n    *   The consequent `( (HasLunchAtHome(James) \u2227 WorksRemotely(James)) \u2228 (\u00acHasLunchAtHome(James) \u2227 \u00acWorksRemotely(James)) )` becomes `(False \u2227 False) \u2228 (True \u2227 True)`, which is `True`.\n    *   Thus, if `Manager(James)` is true, the conclusion is true.\n\n*   **Scenario B: `InOtherCountries(James)` is true.**\n    *   From P5: `WorksRemotely(James)`.\n    *   From P6 and `WorksRemotely(James)`: `\u00acManager(James)`.\n    *   From P7 and `\u00acManager(James)`: `\u00acAppearsInCompany(James)`.\n    *   From P1 and `\u00acAppearsInCompany(James)`: `\u00acSchedulesMeetingWithCustomer(James)`.\n    *   From P2 and `\u00acSchedulesMeetingWithCustomer(James)`: `\u00acHasLunchInCompany(James)`.\n    *   From P3 and `\u00acHasLunchInCompany(James)`: `HasLunchAtHome(James)`.\n    *   So, we have `HasLunchAtHome(James)` and `WorksRemotely(James)`.\n    *   The consequent `( (HasLunchAtHome(James) \u2227 WorksRemotely(James)) \u2228 (\u00acHasLunchAtHome(James) \u2227 \u00acWorksRemotely(James)) )` becomes `(True \u2227 True) \u2228 (False \u2227 False)`, which is `True`.\n    *   Thus, if `InOtherCountries(James)` is true, the conclusion is true.\n\nSince the conclusion holds true in both cases where its antecedent `(Manager(James) \u2228 InOtherCountries(James))` is true, the conclusion follows from the premises.\n\nThe key was realizing that P7 in conjunction with other premises forces a specific outcome for James if he is in other countries or a manager. My initial hesitation came from not fully integrating P7 or the logical implications of `WorksRemotely` and `AppearsInCompany` via other premises.\n\nThe statement `( (HasLunchAtHome(James) \u2227 WorksRemotely(James)) \u2228 (\u00acHasLunchAtHome(James) \u2227 \u00acWorksRemotely(James)) )` is a tautology in the sense that it means `HasLunchAtHome(James)` and `WorksRemotely(James)` are logically equivalent (i.e., they are either both true or both false). Let's call this `EquivLunchRemote(James)`.\n\nSo the conclusion is `If (Manager(James) \u2228 InOtherCountries(James)), then EquivLunchRemote(James)`.\n\nWe showed:\n1.  If `Manager(James)` then `\u00acHasLunchAtHome(James)` AND `\u00acWorksRemotely(James)`. This implies `EquivLunchRemote(James)` is true.\n2.  If `InOtherCountries(James)` then `HasLunchAtHome(James)` AND `WorksRemotely(James)`. This implies `EquivLunchRemote(James)` is true.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{True}$"], "answers": ["True"], "reference": "True", "time_total": 20.827906370162964, "time_llm": 20.82702112197876, "prompt_length": 2054}

So, if `Rock` is a `Rabbit`, then `Rock` is `Cute`.\nFrom premise 3, `Animal(x) <-> (Rabbit(x) V Squirrel(x))`.\n\nWe know `NOT Squirrel(Rock)`.\nIf `Rock` is an `Animal`, then `Rock` must be a `Rabbit` (because it's not a `Squirrel`).\nIf `Rock` is a `Rabbit`, then `Rock` is `Cute`.\n\nHowever, the premises do *not* state that `Rock` is an `Animal`.\nIf `Rock` is *not* an `Animal`, then `Rabbit(Rock)` is false, and `Squirrel(Rock)` is false. In this case, `Cute(Rock)` would not necessarily follow from `Rabbit(x) -> Cute(x)`.\nFor example, `Rock` could be an inanimate object that is `Still`. The premises allow for `Rock` to be `Still` without being an `Animal`.\n\nSo, we cannot definitively conclude that `Cute(Rock)` is true.\nSince `NOT Skittish(Rock)` is true, and we cannot definitively say `Cute(Rock)` is true, we cannot definitively say that `(Cute(Rock) V Skittish(Rock))` is true.\n\n**Conclusion Evaluation:**\n\nWe found that the antecedent `NOT (Turtle(Rock) AND Squirrel(Rock))` is true.\nFor the overall implication `A -> B` to be true, if `A` is true, then `B` must also be true.\nSince we cannot definitively prove `(Cute(Rock) V Skittish(Rock))` (the consequent), the conclusion does not *necessarily* follow.\n\nConsider a scenario:\n`Still(Rock)` is true.\n`Skittish(Rock)` is false.

(If `Skittish(Rock)` were true, then `NOT Still(Rock)` would have to be true, which contradicts `Still(Rock)` being true).\n\nSo, we've deduced that `Skittish(Rock)` is **false**.\n\nNow consider the consequent `Turtle(Rock) AND Skittish(Rock)`.\nSince `Skittish(Rock)` is false, the conjunction `Turtle(Rock) AND Skittish(Rock)` must also be **false**, regardless of whether `Turtle(Rock)` is true or false.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion `[Cute(Rock) AND Still(Rock)] -> [Turtle(Rock) AND Skittish(Rock)]` becomes `[Cute(Rock)] -> [False]`.\n\nFor an implication `A -> B` to be true, if `B` is false, then `A` must also be false.\nIn our case, for `[Cute(Rock)] -> [False]` to be true, `Cute(Rock)` must be false.\n\nHowever, the premises do not give us any information about whether `Rock` is cute or not.\nPremise 1 states `Rabbit(x) -> Cute(x)`. We don't know if Rock is a rabbit.\nPremise 3 states `Animal(x) -> (Rabbit(x) OR Squirrel(x))`. We don't know if Rock is an animal.\n\nSo, we cannot definitively say whether `Cute(Rock)` is true or false.\nIf `Cute(Rock)` is true, then `True -> False` which is false.\nIf `Cute(Rock)` is false, then `False -> False` which is true.\n\nSince the truth value of `Cute(Rock)` is unknown, the truth value of the entire conclusion is uncertain.\n\nLet's re-verify the deduction for `Skittish(Rock)`.\nP4: `Skittish(x) -> NOT Still(x)`\nP6: `Still(Rock)`\nFrom P6, by modus tollens on P4, if `Still(Rock)` is true, then `NOT (NOT Still(Rock))` is true, which means `Still(Rock)` is true.\nSo, if `Still(Rock)` is true, then `Skittish(Rock)` must be false.\nThis deduction is correct. `Skittish(Rock)` is indeed false.\n\nSince the consequent `Turtle(Rock) AND Skittish(Rock)` is false (because `Skittish(Rock)` is false), the only way for the implication `[Cute(Rock) AND Still(Rock)] -> [Turtle(Rock) AND Skittish(Rock)]` to be true is if the antecedent `[Cute(Rock) AND Still(Rock)]` is also false.\nWe know `Still(Rock)` is true. So the antecedent simplifies to `Cute(Rock)`.\nFor the conclusion to be true, `Cute(Rock)` must be false.\nThe premises do not provide information to determine if `Cute(Rock)` is false.\nTherefore, the conclusion is uncertain.\n\nANSWER: Uncertain"], "answers": ["Uncertain"], "reference": "False", "time_total": 5.6739490032196045, "time_llm": 5.673572063446045, "prompt_length": 1580}

(This is consistent with `NOT FromEarth(Marvin)` because if he were from Earth, he'd be human by P4).\n*   We know `Extraterrestrial(Marvin)`. What about `Alien(Marvin)`?\n*   We have `Alien(x) -> Extraterrestrial(x)` (P1). This means if someone is an alien, they are extraterrestrial. It does *not* mean if someone is extraterrestrial, they are an alien. The reverse is not necessarily true. For example, there could be extraterrestrial rocks, but rocks are not aliens.\n\nSo, if `Extraterrestrial(Marvin)`, we cannot definitively conclude `Alien(Marvin)` based *only* on P1.\n\nHowever, let's re-examine the implications:\n\nIf `NOT FromEarth(Marvin)`:\n1.  `Extraterrestrial(Marvin)` (from P6)\n2.  `NOT Human(Marvin)` (from P3 and `Extraterrestrial(Marvin)`)\n\nWe need to know if `Alien(Marvin)`.\nFrom P2: `FromMars(Marvin) -> Alien(Marvin)`.\n\nLet's try to derive a contradiction if `NOT Alien(Marvin)`.\n\nAssume `NOT Alien(Marvin)`.\n*   If `NOT Alien(Marvin)`, then from P2, `FromMars(Marvin)` is not necessarily false.\n*   If `NOT Alien(Marvin)`, then from P1 (contrapositive), `NOT Extraterrestrial(Marvin)`.\n\nNow, combine this with our previous deductions.\nIf `NOT Alien(Marvin)` implies `NOT Extraterrestrial(Marvin)`.\nBut we also know that `NOT FromEarth(Marvin) -> Extraterrestrial(Marvin)` (P6).\n\nThis means if `NOT FromEarth(Marvin)`, we get `Extraterrestrial(Marvin)`.\nAnd if `Alien(Marvin)` were false, we'd get `NOT Extraterrestrial(Marvin)`.\nThese two (`Extraterrestrial(Marvin)` and `NOT Extraterrestrial(Marvin)`) are contradictory.\n\nTherefore, our assumption `NOT Alien(Marvin)` must be false, *given* that `NOT FromEarth(Marvin)`.\nSo, if `NOT FromEarth(Marvin)`, then `Alien(Marvin)` must be true.\n\nNow, let's revisit Case 1: `FromEarth(Marvin)`.\nWe found that if `FromEarth(Marvin)`, then `NOT Alien(Marvin)`.\n\nSo, the conclusion `Marvin is an alien` is true if `NOT FromEarth(Marvin)`, but false if `FromEarth(Marvin)`.\nSince we don't know whether Marvin is from Earth or not, the conclusion is uncertain.\n\nLet's double-check the reasoning for `NOT FromEarth(Marvin) -> Alien(Marvin)`:\n1. `NOT FromEarth(Marvin)` (Assumption)\n2. `Extraterrestrial(Marvin)` (From 1 and P6)\n3. `NOT Human(Marvin)` (From 2 and P3)\n4. We want to prove `Alien(Marvin)`.\n5. We have `Alien(x) -> Extraterrestrial(x)` (P1). This is `Extraterrestrial(x) OR NOT Alien(x)`.\n6. We also have `FromMars(x) -> Alien(x)` (P2). This is `Alien(x) OR NOT FromMars(x)`.\n\nLet's use resolution or proof by contradiction more rigorously.\nAssume `NOT Alien(Marvin)`.\n\n1. `NOT Alien(Marvin)` (Assumption to prove by contradiction)\n2. `NOT Extraterrestrial(Marvin)` (From 1 and P1: `Alien(x) -> Extraterrestrial(x)` which is `NOT Extraterrestrial(x) -> NOT Alien(x)`)\n3. `FromEarth(Marvin)` (From 2 and P6: `NOT FromEarth(Marvin) -> Extraterrestrial(Marvin)` which is `NOT Extraterrestrial(Marvin) -> FromEarth(Marvin)`)\n4. `Human(Marvin)` (From 3 and P4: `FromEarth(x) -> Human(x)`)\n5. `NOT FromMars(Marvin)` (From 1 and P2: `FromMars(x) -> Alien(x)` which is `NOT Alien(x) -> NOT FromMars(x)`)\n6. `FromEarth(Marvin) AND NOT FromMars(Marvin)` (From 3 and 5)\n\nThis derivation (assuming `NOT Alien(Marvin)`) leads to `FromEarth(Marvin) AND NOT FromMars(Marvin)`.\nThis is *not* a contradiction with any of the premises.\nPremise 5 states `NOT (FromEarth(Marvin) AND FromMars(Marvin))`.\nOur derived `FromEarth(Marvin) AND NOT FromMars(Marvin)` is perfectly consistent with Premise 5.\n\nSo, the previous conclusion that `NOT FromEarth(Marvin) -> Alien(Marvin)` was incorrect.\nLet's re-evaluate:\n\nIf `NOT FromEarth(Marvin)`:\n*   Then `Extraterrestrial(Marvin)` (by P6).\n*   From `Extraterrestrial(Marvin)` and P1 (`Alien(x) -> Extraterrestrial(x)`), we *cannot* infer `Alien(Marvin)`. P1 only says aliens are extraterrestrial, not that all extraterrestrials are aliens.\n\nTherefore, whether Marvin is from Earth or not:\n*   If `FromEarth(Marvin)`:\n    *   `Human(Marvin)` (P4)\n    *   `NOT Extraterrestrial(Marvin)` (P3)\n    *   `NOT Alien(Marvin)` (P1)\n    *   `NOT FromMars(Marvin)` (P5)\n    In this case, the conclusion `Alien(Marvin)` is False.\n\n*   If `NOT FromEarth(Marvin)`:\n    *   `Extraterrestrial(Marvin)` (P6)\n    *   `NOT Human(Marvin)` (P3)\n    *   What about `Alien(Marvin)`? We know `Extraterrestrial(Marvin)`.\n    *   From `Extraterrestrial(Marvin)` and P1 (`Alien(x) -> Extraterrestrial(x)`), we *cannot* deduce `Alien(Marvin)`.\n    *   From P2 (`FromMars(x) -> Alien(x)`), if Marvin is from Mars, then he is an alien. But we don't know if he is from Mars.\n    *   P5 (`NOT (FromEarth(Marvin) AND FromMars(Marvin))`) doesn't help much here if we know `NOT FromEarth(Marvin)`. It just means `FromMars(Marvin)` *could* be true or false.\n\nSince we don't know if `FromEarth(Marvin)` or `NOT FromEarth(Marvin)` is true, and the conclusion depends on it, the answer is Uncertain.\n\nLet's consider an example:\nSuppose Marvin is an extraterrestrial rock.\n*   P1: All aliens are extraterrestrial (true for rock)\n*   P2: If someone is from Mars, then they are aliens (rock is not from Mars, so true)\n*   P3: No extraterrestrial is human (rock is not human, true)\n*   P4: Everyone from Earth is a human (rock is not from Earth, true)\n*   P5: Marvin cannot be from Earth and from Mars (rock is neither, true)\n*   P6: If Marvin is not from Earth, then Marvin is an extraterrestrial (rock is not from Earth and is extraterrestrial, true)\nIn this scenario, `Alien(Marvin)` is false. So the conclusion can be false.\n\nSuppose Marvin is an alien from Mars.\n*   P1: Alien(Marvin) -> Extraterrestrial(Marvin) (True)\n*   P2: FromMars(Marvin) -> Alien(Marvin) (True)\n*   P3: Extraterrestrial(Marvin) -> NOT Human(Marvin) (True, aliens are not human)\n*   P4: FromEarth(Marvin) -> Human(Marvin) (True, Marvin is not from Earth)\n*   P5: NOT (FromEarth(Marvin) AND FromMars(Marvin)) (True, Marvin is not from Earth)\n*   P6: NOT FromEarth(Marvin) -> Extraterrestrial(Marvin) (True, Marvin is not from Earth and is extraterrestrial)\nIn this scenario, `Alien(Marvin)` is true. So the conclusion can be true.\n\nSince the conclusion can be true in some consistent models and false in others, it is Uncertain.\n\nThe key point is that `Extraterrestrial(x)` does not imply `Alien(x)`.\n\nTherefore, if `NOT FromEarth(Marvin)`, we get `Extraterrestrial(Marvin)`, but this doesn't force `Alien(Marvin)`.\n\nFinal check:\nIf Marvin is from Earth:\n- Marvin is human (P4).\n- Marvin is not extraterrestrial (P3).\n- Marvin is not alien (P1).\n- Marvin is not from Mars (P5).\nThis is consistent. Conclusion (Marvin is an alien) is False.\n\nIf Marvin is NOT from Earth:\n- Marvin is extraterrestrial (P6).\n- Marvin is not human (P3).\n- Marvin may or may not be alien. We only know `Alien(x) -> Extraterrestrial(x)`. `Extraterrestrial(x)` does not imply `Alien(x)`.\n- Marvin may or may not be from Mars (P5 only rules out being *both* from Earth and Mars, and we already know he's not from Earth).\nIf Marvin is NOT from Earth and NOT from Mars, and is an extraterrestrial object (e.g., a meteorite), then Marvin is not an alien. This is consistent with all premises. Conclusion (Marvin is an alien) is False.\nIf Marvin is NOT from Earth and IS from Mars, then Marvin is an alien (P2). This is consistent. Conclusion (Marvin is an alien) is True.\n\nSince there are consistent scenarios where the conclusion is true and where it is false, the conclusion is Uncertain.\n\nThe previous internal thought process had an error in deducing `Alien(Marvin)` from `Extraterrestrial(Marvin)` and `NOT Alien(Marvin) -> NOT Extraterrestrial(Marvin)`. The latter is the contrapositive of P1, which is correct. The error was assuming `NOT Alien(Marvin)` would lead to a contradiction under `NOT FromEarth(Marvin)`. Let's re-examine that specific step:\n\nAssume `NOT Alien(Marvin)`.\nFrom P1: `Alien(x) -> Extraterrestrial(x)`. The contrapositive is `NOT Extraterrestrial(x) -> NOT Alien(x)`. This is correctly applied.\nIf `NOT Alien(Marvin)`, then from the contrapositive of P1, `NOT Extraterrestrial(Marvin)` is *not* necessarily true. It only means that if `Extraterrestrial(Marvin)` is true, then `Alien(Marvin)` *could* be true.\n\nLet's rephrase `Alien(x) -> Extraterrestrial(x)` as `NOT Alien(x) OR Extraterrestrial(x)`.\nIf we assume `NOT Alien(Marvin)`, then this premise becomes `True OR Extraterrestrial(Marvin)`, which is always `True`. It doesn't tell us anything about `Extraterrestrial(Marvin)`.\n\nSo, the step \"If `NOT Alien(Marvin)`, then from P1 (contrapositive: `NOT Extraterrestrial(x) -> NOT Alien(x)`): `NOT Extraterrestrial(Marvin)`\" was incorrect.\nThe correct application of the contrapositive `NOT Extraterrestrial(x) -> NOT Alien(x)` is: if we know `NOT Extraterrestrial(Marvin)`, then we can conclude `NOT Alien(Marvin)`.\nBut here, we started by *assuming* `NOT Alien(Marvin)`, and we want to see what follows.\n\nIf we assume `NOT Alien(Marvin)`:\n1. `NOT Alien(Marvin)` (Assumption)\n2. From P2 (`FromMars(x) -> Alien(x)`), this means `NOT FromMars(Marvin)` (because if `FromMars(Marvin)` were true, then `Alien(Marvin)` would be true, contradicting 1).\n3. From P5 (`NOT (FromEarth(Marvin) AND FromMars(Marvin))`), since we know `NOT FromMars(Marvin)` (from 2), P5 is satisfied regardless of `FromEarth(Marvin)`.\n4. From P6 (`NOT FromEarth(Marvin) -> Extraterrestrial(Marvin)`).\n   *   If `FromEarth(Marvin)` is true:\n       *   Then `Human(Marvin)` (P4).\n       *   Then `NOT Extraterrestrial(Marvin)` (P3).\n       *   Then `NOT Alien(Marvin)` (P1 contrapositive). This is consistent with our assumption.\n   *   If `NOT FromEarth(Marvin)` is true:\n       *   Then `Extraterrestrial(Marvin)` (P6).\n       *   Then `NOT Human(Marvin)` (P3).\n       *   Does `Extraterrestrial(Marvin)` contradict `NOT Alien(Marvin)`? No. P1 (`Alien(x) -> Extraterrestrial(x)`) allows for `Extraterrestrial(Marvin)` to be true while `Alien(Marvin)` is false. (e.g., an extraterrestrial rock is not an alien).\n\nSo, the assumption `NOT Alien(Marvin)` does not lead to a contradiction with the premises. This means `NOT Alien(Marvin)` is possible.\nSince `Alien(Marvin)` is also possible (e.g., if Marvin is an alien from Mars), the conclusion is Uncertain.\n\nThe reasoning for the final answer is sound.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{Uncertain}$"], "answers": ["Uncertain"], "reference": "False", "time_total": 21.15158486366272, "time_llm": 21.150639295578003, "prompt_length": 1610}

(So the first part of the conclusion holds)\n*   Now we need to check `NOT FromMars(Marvin)`.\n    *   From P2: `FromMars(Marvin) -> Alien(Marvin)`\n    *   From P1: `Alien(Marvin) -> Extraterrestrial(Marvin)`\n    *   Combining these: `FromMars(Marvin) -> Extraterrestrial(Marvin)`.\n    *   We already know `Extraterrestrial(Marvin)` is true in this case (from P6). This means `FromMars(Marvin)` *could* be true, or it *could* be false. The fact that Marvin is extraterrestrial doesn't tell us if he's from Mars or some other extraterrestrial place.\n\n    Let's re-examine: If `NOT FromEarth(Marvin)` is true, then `Extraterrestrial(Marvin)` is true, and `NOT Human(Marvin)` is true.\n    Now, is `NOT FromMars(Marvin)` necessarily true?\n    Suppose `FromMars(Marvin)` is true.\n    *   Then, from P2, `Alien(Marvin)` is true.\n    *   Then, from P1, `Extraterrestrial(Marvin)` is true.\n    *   This is consistent with `NOT FromEarth(Marvin)` (which led to `Extraterrestrial(Marvin)` via P6).\n    *   Also, if `FromMars(Marvin)` is true, then from P5, `NOT FromEarth(Marvin)` must be true. This is also consistent.\n\n    So, if `NOT FromEarth(Marvin)`, then `NOT Human(Marvin)` is true. However, `FromMars(Marvin)` could still be true (and consistent with all premises). If `FromMars(Marvin)` is true, then `NOT FromMars(Marvin)` is false.\n\n    Therefore, in `Case B` (Marvin is not from Earth), we know `NOT Human(Marvin)` is true, but `NOT FromMars(Marvin)` is not necessarily true. It could be that Marvin is from Mars (and thus not from Earth, and extraterrestrial, and not human).\n\n**Conclusion Evaluation:**\n\nThe conclusion `Marvin is neither a human nor from Mars` means `NOT Human(Marvin) AND NOT FromMars(Marvin)`.\n\nWe found a scenario (Case A: Marvin is from Earth) where `Human(Marvin)` is true, which makes `NOT Human(Marvin)` false, and thus the entire conclusion false.\n\nWe also found a scenario (Case B: Marvin is not from Earth, and is from Mars) where `NOT Human(Marvin)` is true, but `FromMars(Marvin)` is true, which makes `NOT FromMars(Marvin)` false, and thus the entire conclusion false.\n\nSince we can construct scenarios consistent with the premises where the conclusion is false, the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises.\n\nLet's summarize:\n1.

Let's assume it means \"Djokovic is well paid\" or \"Djokovic lives in a tax haven\" in the context of the problem, given the conclusion. However, for now, let's stick to the literal wording and see if it creates a contradiction or allows us to conclude anything.)\n\nNow, let's analyze Djokovic:\n\n*   Premise 1 states Djokovic is either a Grand Slam champion or an Oscar-nominated actor.\n\n**Case 1: Djokovic is a Grand Slam champion.**\n    *   From (2), Djokovic is a professional tennis player.\n    *   From (4), Djokovic is an athlete.\n    *   From (6), if Djokovic is an athlete, then Djokovic is famous. So, Djokovic is famous.\n    *   Now we have: Djokovic is famous AND Djokovic is an athlete.\n    *   From (8), if Djokovic is famous and is an athlete, then Djokovic \"lives in well paid\". This phrase is problematic. If it means \"Djokovic is well paid\", then from (7), Djokovic lives in a tax haven. If it means \"Djokovic lives in a tax haven\", then Djokovic lives in a tax haven.\n\n**Case 2: Djokovic is an Oscar-nominated actor.**\n    *   From (3), Djokovic is a celebrity.\n    *   From (5), if Djokovic is a celebrity, then Djokovic is well paid. So, Djokovic is well paid.\n    *   From (7), if Djokovic is well paid, then Djokovic lives in a tax haven. So, Djokovic lives in a tax haven.\n\nIn both possible cases for Djokovic (Grand Slam champion or Oscar-nominated actor), we conclude that Djokovic lives in a tax haven, assuming \"lives in well paid\" in premise 8 implies living in a tax haven or being well paid.\n\nLet's re-evaluate premise 8 more strictly. \"If Djokovic is famous and is an athlete, then Djokovic lives in well paid.\" This phrase \"lives in well paid\" is grammatically incorrect and semantically unclear.\n\nIf we interpret \"lives in well paid\" as meaning \"is well paid\", then:\n*   Case 1 (Grand Slam champion): Djokovic is an athlete and famous. From (8), Djokovic is well paid. From (7), Djokovic lives in a tax haven.\n*   Case 2 (Oscar-nominated actor): Djokovic is well paid (from 3 and 5). From (7), Djokovic lives in a tax haven.\n\nIn this interpretation, Djokovic *does* live in a tax haven.\n\nIf we interpret \"lives in well paid\" as a direct statement that Djokovic lives in a tax haven (i.e., a poorly phrased way of saying \"Djokovic lives in a tax haven\"), then:\n*   Case 1 (Grand Slam champion): Djokovic is an athlete and famous. From (8), Djokovic lives in a tax haven.\n*   Case 2 (Oscar-nominated actor): Djokovic is well paid (from 3 and 5). From (7), Djokovic lives in a tax haven.\n\nIn this interpretation, Djokovic *does* live in a tax haven.\n\nThe conclusion is \"Djokovic does not live in a tax haven.\"\nBased on both plausible interpretations of the ambiguous premise 8, we consistently deduce that Djokovic *does* live in a tax haven. Therefore, the conclusion \"Djokovic does not live in a tax haven\" is false.\n\nFinal check on the reasoning:\n1. Djokovic is either a Grand Slam champion (GSC) or an Oscar-nominated actor (ONA).\n2. If GSC -> Professional Tennis Player (PTP)\n3. If ONA -> Celebrity (C)\n4. If PTP -> Athlete (A)\n5. If C -> Well Paid (WP)\n6. If A -> Famous (F)\n7. If WP -> Lives in Tax Haven (LTH)\n8. If Djokovic is F and A -> Djokovic lives in well paid (Ambiguous, let's assume this means Djokovic is WP or LTH)\n\nScenario 1: Djokovic is GSC\n    -> PTP (from 2)\n    -> A (from 4)\n    -> F (from 6)\n    Now Djokovic is F and A.\n    From 8, Djokovic \"lives in well paid\".\n        If \"lives in well paid\" means WP, then from 7, Djokovic LTH.\n        If \"lives in well paid\" means LTH, then Djokovic LTH.\n\nScenario 2: Djokovic is ONA\n    -> C (from 3)\n    -> WP (from 5)\n    -> LTH (from 7)\n\nIn both scenarios, Djokovic lives in a tax haven. Therefore, the conclusion \"Djokovic does not live in a tax haven\" is false.\n\nThe most critical part is the interpretation of \"Djokovic lives in well paid\". Given the context of the conclusion about living in a tax haven and premise 7 connecting \"well paid\" to \"tax havens\", it's highly likely that \"lives in well paid\" is intended to either mean \"is well paid\" (leading to tax haven via premise 7) or directly \"lives in a tax haven\".

Let's look at premise 6, as it directly mentions `DesignByMax`.\n\nPremise 6 states: `If DesignByMax is timeless, then DesignByMax is a mass product design AND DesignByMax is evocative.`\n`IsTimeless(DesignByMax) -> (IsMassProductDesign(DesignByMax) AND IsEvocative(DesignByMax))`\n\nFrom this premise, we can infer:\n`IsTimeless(DesignByMax) -> IsMassProductDesign(DesignByMax)`\n\nNow, we need to determine if `DesignByMax` is timeless or not.\n\n*   If `IsTimeless(DesignByMax)` is True, then by premise 6, `IsMassProductDesign(DesignByMax)` is True.\n*   If `IsTimeless(DesignByMax)` is False, then premise 6 tells us nothing about `IsMassProductDesign(DesignByMax)`. It could be a mass product design, or it might not be.\n\nLet's check if we can determine if `DesignByMax` is timeless or not.\nPremise 1: All Zaha Hadid's design styles are timeless.\nPremise 2: No mass product design is timeless.\n\nWe don't know if `DesignByMax` is a Zaha Hadid design style, a Kelly Wearstler design style, or even a design style at all. The premises are about \"design styles\" in general or specific designers' styles. \"A design by Max\" doesn't necessarily fall into these categories. For instance, \"A design by Max\" could be a one-off custom piece that is timeless, and if it's timeless, it *must* be a mass product design according to premise 6. But premise 2 states no mass product design is timeless, which creates a contradiction if DesignByMax is timeless and a mass product design.\n\nLet's assume `DesignByMax` *is* a design style, as the context implies.\nIf `IsDesignStyle(DesignByMax)` is true:\nThen by premise 3, `IsZahaHadidDesignStyle(DesignByMax) OR IsKellyWearstlerDesignStyle(DesignByMax)`.\n\n*   **Case 1: `IsZahaHadidDesignStyle(DesignByMax)`**\n    *   By premise 1, `IsTimeless(DesignByMax)`.\n    *   Since `IsTimeless(DesignByMax)` is true, by premise 6, `IsMassProductDesign(DesignByMax)` must be true.\n    *   However, if `IsMassProductDesign(DesignByMax)` is true, then by premise 2, `Not IsTimeless(DesignByMax)`.\n    *   This creates a contradiction: `IsTimeless(DesignByMax)` and `Not IsTimeless(DesignByMax)`.\n    *   This means `DesignByMax` cannot be a Zaha Hadid design style if we assume it's a design style and premise 6 holds.\n\n*   **Case 2: `IsKellyWearstlerDesignStyle(DesignByMax)`**\n    *   By premise 4, `IsEvocative(DesignByMax)`.\n    *   By premise 5, `IsDreamy(DesignByMax)`.\n    *   We don't know if `IsTimeless(DesignByMax)` from these premises.\n        *   If `IsTimeless(DesignByMax)` is true, then by premise 6, `IsMassProductDesign(DesignByMax)` is true. (But again, this would lead to a contradiction with premise 2: `IsTimeless(DesignByMax)` and `IsMassProductDesign(DesignByMax)` implies `Not IsTimeless(DesignByMax)`.)\n        *   If `IsTimeless(DesignByMax)` is false, then premise 6 tells us nothing about `IsMassProductDesign(DesignByMax)`. It could be true or false.\n\nThe core issue lies in the interaction between premises 2 and 6.\n\nPremise 2: `IsMassProductDesign(x) -> Not IsTimeless(x)`\nPremise 6: `IsTimeless(DesignByMax) -> (IsMassProductDesign(DesignByMax) AND IsEvocative(DesignByMax))`\n\nLet's assume `IsTimeless(DesignByMax)` is true.\nFrom Premise 6, it implies `IsMassProductDesign(DesignByMax)`.\nBut if `IsMassProductDesign(DesignByMax)` is true, then from Premise 2, it implies `Not IsTimeless(DesignByMax)`.\nThis is a contradiction: `IsTimeless(DesignByMax)` AND `Not IsTimeless(DesignByMax)`.\n\nThis means our assumption that `IsTimeless(DesignByMax)` is true *must be false*.\nTherefore, `Not IsTimeless(DesignByMax)` must be true.\n\nIf `Not IsTimeless(DesignByMax)` is true, what does premise 6 tell us?\n`False -> (IsMassProductDesign(DesignByMax) AND IsEvocative(DesignByMax))`\nA false antecedent makes the implication `True` regardless of the consequent. So, `Not IsTimeless(DesignByMax)` being true tells us nothing about `IsMassProductDesign(DesignByMax)` from premise 6 alone.\n\nWe have established `Not IsTimeless(DesignByMax)`.\nNow, can we determine `IsMassProductDesign(DesignByMax)`?\nWe know `DesignByMax` is not timeless.\nIf `DesignByMax` *were* a mass product design, then `IsMassProductDesign(DesignByMax)` would be true, which is consistent with `Not IsTimeless(DesignByMax)` (from premise 2).\nIf `DesignByMax` *were not* a mass product design, then `Not IsMassProductDesign(DesignByMax)` would be true, which is also consistent with `Not IsTimeless(DesignByMax)`.\n\nThe premises do not provide enough information to definitively conclude whether \"A design by Max is a mass product design.\" The fact that it cannot be timeless (due to the contradiction derived from premises 2 and 6) doesn't force it to be a mass product design.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is uncertain.\n\nFinal check:\n1.  Assume `IsTimeless(DesignByMax)` is True.\n    *   From (6): `IsMassProductDesign(DesignByMax)` AND `IsEvocative(DesignByMax)`.\n    *   From (2): If `IsMassProductDesign(DesignByMax)`, then `Not IsTimeless(DesignByMax)`.\n    *   This leads to `IsTimeless(DesignByMax)` AND `Not IsTimeless(DesignByMax)`, a contradiction.\n    *   Therefore, the assumption `IsTimeless(DesignByMax)` must be False. So, `Not IsTimeless(DesignByMax)` is True.\n\n2.  We know `Not IsTimeless(DesignByMax)`.\n    *   Does this imply `IsMassProductDesign(DesignByMax)`?\n    *   No. If it's not timeless, it *could* be a mass product design (consistent with P2), or it *could* be something else entirely (e.g., a one-off non-timeless piece that is not a mass product). The premises do not eliminate the latter possibility.\n\nFor example, consider a scenario:\n- A design by Max is not timeless. (Established from contradiction)\n- A design by Max is *not* a mass product design. (This is consistent with `Not IsTimeless(DesignByMax)`)\n- Premise 6 (`IsTimeless(DesignByMax) -> (IsMassProductDesign(DesignByMax) AND IsEvocative(DesignByMax))`) becomes `False -> (False AND IsEvocative(DesignByMax))`, which is `True -> False`, which is `True`. So, this scenario does not violate premise 6.\n- Premise 2 (`IsMassProductDesign(x) -> Not IsTimeless(x)`) becomes `False -> Not IsTimeless(DesignByMax)`, which is `True`. So, this scenario does not violate premise 2.\n- The other premises don't directly constrain `DesignByMax` unless it's explicitly identified as a Zaha Hadid or Kelly Wearstler design style. Even if it were, we've shown it can't be Zaha Hadid, and if it's Kelly Wearstler, it's not timeless, and we still can't tell if it's mass product or not.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion `A design by Max is a mass product design` cannot be definitively proven.\n\nANSWER: Uncertain"], "answers": ["Uncertain"], "reference": "Uncertain", "time_total": 12.508038759231567, "time_llm": 12.5075044631958, "prompt_length": 1732}

We want to know if `Evocative(d) AND Dreamy(d)` is true.\n\nFrom premise 6: `DesignByMax(d) AND Timeless(d) -> (MassProductDesign(d) AND Evocative(d))`\n\nThis tells us what happens *if* a design by Max is timeless.\n\n*   **Case 1: Assume `Timeless(d)` is true for a design `d` by Max.**\n    *   From premise 6: `MassProductDesign(d)` and `Evocative(d)` are true.\n    *   However, from premise 2: `Timeless(d) -> NOT MassProductDesign(d)`.\n    *   This creates a contradiction: If `Timeless(d)` is true, then `MassProductDesign(d)` must be false (from P2), but also `MassProductDesign(d)` must be true (from P6).\n    *   Therefore, the assumption `Timeless(d)` for a design by Max must be **false**.\n    *   This means `NOT Timeless(d)` is true for any design `d` by Max.\n\nSo, we've established that `A design by Max is NOT timeless`.\n\nNow we know `NOT Timeless(d)` for any `DesignByMax(d)`.\n\nThe conclusion states `Evocative(d) AND Dreamy(d)`.\n\n*   We know `NOT Timeless(d)`. This doesn't directly tell us anything about `Evocative(d)` or `Dreamy(d)`.\n*   Premise 6 was an implication: `If Timeless(d) THEN ...`. Since the antecedent (`Timeless(d)`) is false, the implication itself is true, but it doesn't force the consequent (`MassProductDesign(d) AND Evocative(d)`) to be true or false. It just means the condition for `MassProductDesign(d) AND Evocative(d)` to be true via this premise is not met.\n\nLet's look at how `Evocative` and `Dreamy` are introduced in the premises:\n*   Premise 4: `KellyWearstlerDesignStyle(x) -> Evocative(x)`\n*   Premise 5: `KellyWearstlerDesignStyle(x) -> Dreamy(x)`\n\nThe only way we can deduce `Evocative(d)` or `Dreamy(d)` from these premises is if we know `KellyWearstlerDesignStyle(d)`.\n\nIs there any premise that links \"Design by Max\" to \"Kelly Wearstler's design style\"?\n*   Premise 3: \"Either Zaha Hadid's design style or Kelly Wearstler's design style.\" This seems to refer to *all* design styles. If a design by Max is a \"design style\", then it must be one or the other.\n    *   If `DesignByMax(d)` implies `DesignStyle(d)`, then `ZahaHadidDesignStyle(d) OR KellyWearstlerDesignStyle(d)`.\n\n    *   If `ZahaHadidDesignStyle(d)`, then `Timeless(d)` (from P1). But we already deduced `NOT Timeless(d)` for any design by Max.\n    *   Therefore, if `DesignByMax(d)` implies `DesignStyle(d)`, then it *must* be `KellyWearstlerDesignStyle(d)`.\n\n    *   If `KellyWearstlerDesignStyle(d)`, then `Evocative(d)` (from P4) and `Dreamy(d)` (from P5).\n    *   This would lead to the conclusion being true.\n\n**The crucial assumption:** Is \"a design by Max\" considered a \"design style\" in the context of premise 3?\nThe problem refers to \"Zaha Hadid's design styles\" and \"Kelly Wearstler's design styles\" as categories. \"A design by Max\" refers to a specific design, not necessarily a *style* of design. If \"a design by Max\" is just *a design* and not a *design style*, then premise 3 doesn't apply to it, and we cannot deduce that it is a Kelly Wearstler design style.\n\nIf \"a design by Max\" is *not* necessarily a \"design style\", then we have no information about whether it is Evocative or Dreamy.\n\nLet's re-read the premises carefully for this interpretation:\nP1: All of Zaha Hadid's *design styles* are timeless.\nP3: Either Zaha Hadid's *design style* or Kelly Wearstler's *design style*. (This usually means every *type* of design style falls into one of these categories).\nP4: All of Kelly Wearstler's *design styles* are evocative.\nP5: All of Kelly Wearstler's *design styles* are dreamy.\n\nP6: If a *design* by Max is timeless, then a *design* by Max is a mass product *design* and evocative.\n\nThe language shifts from \"design styles\" to \"a design by Max\". It's not explicitly stated that \"a design by Max\" *is* a \"design style\".\n\nIf we assume \"a design by Max\" is a *type* of design style, then the conclusion is true.\nIf we assume \"a design by Max\" is just *a design* (an instance), and not necessarily fitting into the general \"design style\" categories of P1, P3, P4, P5, then we don't have enough information.\n\nIn FOL problems, we typically assume the most direct interpretation. \"A design by Max\" is a specific design. It's not stated that it belongs to \"Zaha Hadid's design style\" or \"Kelly Wearstler's design style\" or even that it is a \"design style\" itself.\n\nLet's stick to the deduction that a design by Max is NOT timeless.\n`DesignByMax(d) -> NOT Timeless(d)`\n\nFrom P6: `DesignByMax(d) AND Timeless(d) -> (MassProductDesign(d) AND Evocative(d))`\nSince we know `NOT Timeless(d)`, the antecedent `DesignByMax(d) AND Timeless(d)` is false.\nWhen the antecedent of an implication is false, the implication itself is true, regardless of the consequent. This means P6 gives us no information about `Evocative(d)` or `MassProductDesign(d)` for a design by Max.\n\nSo, we know `NOT Timeless(d)`.\nWe need to know if `Evocative(d)` and `Dreamy(d)` are true.\nThe only way to get `Evocative` or `Dreamy` is via `KellyWearstlerDesignStyle(x)`.\nThere is no premise linking `DesignByMax(x)` to `KellyWearstlerDesignStyle(x)`.\n\nPremise 3: \"Either Zaha Hadid's design style or Kelly Wearstler's design style.\" This talks about *design styles* in general, not individual *designs*. If a design by Max is not necessarily a \"design style\" in the same categorical sense, then this premise doesn't apply to it directly.\n\nConsider an example: Max designs a chair. Is this chair a \"design style\"? Probably not. It's an instance of a design. The premise \"Either Zaha Hadid's design style or Kelly Wearstler's design style\" refers to the *categories* or *types* of design styles that exist.\n\nWithout knowing if a design by Max is a Kelly Wearstler design style (or even a design style at all that fits into P3), we cannot conclude `Evocative(d)` or `Dreamy(d)`.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is uncertain.\n\nFinal check:\n1.  **Deduction from P6 and P2:** If a design by Max (`d`) *were* timeless, then from P6 it would be a mass product design. But from P2, if it's timeless, it's *not* a mass product design. This is a contradiction. Therefore, a design by Max cannot be timeless. `DesignByMax(x) -> NOT Timeless(x)`. This is a solid deduction.\n2.  **Does NOT Timeless(x) help?** No, it doesn't directly imply evocative or dreamy.\n3.  **How to get Evocative/Dreamy?** Only from `KellyWearstlerDesignStyle(x)`.\n4.  **Can we link DesignByMax to KellyWearstlerDesignStyle?**\n    *   P3: \"Either Zaha Hadid's design style or Kelly Wearstler's design style.\"\n    *   If \"a design by Max\" `d` *is* a \"design style\" (a big assumption), then `DesignStyle(d)`.\n    *   Then `ZahaHadidDesignStyle(d) OR KellyWearstlerDesignStyle(d)`.\n    *   If `ZahaHadidDesignStyle(d)`, then `Timeless(d)` (P1). But we know `NOT Timeless(d)`. So `ZahaHadidDesignStyle(d)` must be false.\n    *   This would leave `KellyWearstlerDesignStyle(d)` as the only option, which would lead to the conclusion being true.\n\nThe sticking point is whether \"a design by Max\" counts as a \"design style\" in the same sense as Zaha Hadid's or Kelly Wearstler's. Given the phrasing, it's safer to assume it's just \"a design,\" an instance. If it were meant to be a style, the premise might say \"Max's design style\" or \"Any design style is either...\"\n\nWithout that link, we cannot bridge the gap.\n\nANSWER: Uncertain"], "answers": ["Uncertain"], "reference": "True", "time_total": 15.043553590774536, "time_llm": 15.042961835861206, "prompt_length": 1731}

The most likely interpretation here, given the context of specific designers, is that a design belongs to one of these two categories if it's a design style being discussed. But this premise doesn't seem to directly apply to \"A design by Max\" unless we assume \"A design by Max\" *is* a design style in this context, which is not stated. Let's hold off on making strong inferences from this one for now, as it might be a distractor or only apply to a specific domain not directly related to Max.\n\n4.  `All of Kelly Wearstler's design styles are evocative.`\n    *   `KellyWearstlerStyle(x) -> Evocative(x)`\n\n5.  `All of Kelly Wearstler's design styles are dreamy.`\n    *   `KellyWearstlerStyle(x) -> Dreamy(x)`\n\n6.  `If a design by Max is timeless, then a design by Max is a mass product design and evocative.`\n    *   `Timeless(MaxDesign) -> (MassProductDesign(MaxDesign) AND Evocative(MaxDesign))`\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n`A design by Max is either evocative or dreamy.`\n*   `Evocative(MaxDesign) OR Dreamy(MaxDesign)`\n\n**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**\n\nLet's focus on \"A design by Max\". Let's call it `D_Max`.\n\nFrom Premise 6: `Timeless(D_Max) -> (MassProductDesign(D_Max) AND Evocative(D_Max))`\n\nWe also know from Premise 2: `MassProductDesign(x) -> NOT Timeless(x)`.\nThis means `Timeless(x) -> NOT MassProductDesign(x)`.\n\nNow, let's consider `D_Max`:\n\n**Case 1: `D_Max` is Timeless.**\n*   If `Timeless(D_Max)` is true, then from Premise 6, `MassProductDesign(D_Max)` is true AND `Evocative(D_Max)` is true.\n*   However, if `Timeless(D_Max)` is true, then from Premise 2 (`Timeless(x) -> NOT MassProductDesign(x)`), `NOT MassProductDesign(D_Max)` must be true.\n*   This creates a contradiction: `MassProductDesign(D_Max)` AND `NOT MassProductDesign(D_Max)`.\n*   Therefore, the assumption `Timeless(D_Max)` must be false.\n\n**Conclusion from Case 1:** `D_Max` cannot be timeless.\n*   `NOT Timeless(D_Max)`\n\n**Case 2: `D_Max` is NOT Timeless.**\n*   If `NOT Timeless(D_Max)` is true, then Premise 6 (`Timeless(D_Max) -> (MassProductDesign(D_Max) AND Evocative(D_Max))`) tells us nothing about `D_Max` being mass product design or evocative. An implication `P -> Q` is true if `P` is false, regardless of `Q`.\n*   The fact that `D_Max` is not timeless doesn't tell us if it's evocative or dreamy.\n\n**Re-evaluating the conclusion:** `Evocative(MaxDesign) OR Dreamy(MaxDesign)`\n\nWe established that `D_Max` is `NOT Timeless`. This is derived directly from the premises.\n\nPremises 3, 4, and 5 deal with Zaha Hadid's and Kelly Wearstler's styles. They state that Kelly Wearstler's styles are both evocative and dreamy. However, we have no information linking \"A design by Max\" to either Zaha Hadid's style or Kelly Wearstler's style.\n\nThe only premise that talks about \"A design by Max\" directly is premise 6. And as we showed, it leads to the conclusion that a design by Max cannot be timeless. But if it's not timeless, premise 6 doesn't force it to be evocative or dreamy.\n\nThere are no other premises that link \"A design by Max\" to the properties \"evocative\" or \"dreamy\".\n\nTherefore, we cannot deduce whether \"A design by Max is either evocative or dreamy\" from the given premises.\n\n**Final Check:**\n*   We know `Timeless(MaxDesign)` is false.\n*   The conclusion is `Evocative(MaxDesign) OR Dreamy(MaxDesign)`.\n*   The only link to `Evocative` or `Dreamy` for Max's design is through `Timeless` (P6) or through `KellyWearstlerStyle` (P4, P5).\n*   Since `Timeless(MaxDesign)` is false, P6 tells us nothing about `Evocative(MaxDesign)`.\n*   There is no premise linking `MaxDesign` to `KellyWearstlerStyle`.\n*   Premise 3 (\"Either Zaha Hadid's design style or Kelly Wearstler's design style\") is too general to apply directly to a specific \"design by Max\" unless we assume \"A design by Max\" *must* be one of these two styles, which is not stated. Even if it were, if it's Zaha Hadid's style, we only know it's timeless (P1), which we already know is false for Max's design. If it's Kelly Wearstler's style, then it would be evocative and dreamy.

It only states that *if* someone is a player at RG 2022, they are either female or male.\n\nLet's re-examine. We have established that `NOT MalePlayerRG2022(CocoGauff)`.\nThis was derived from premise 6: `(RankedHighlyWTA(CocoGauff) OR LostToRafaelNadal(CocoGauff)) -> NOT MalePlayerRG2022(CocoGauff)`.\nFor this implication to be true and for `NOT MalePlayerRG2022(CocoGauff)` to be derived, we must assume `(RankedHighlyWTA(CocoGauff) OR LostToRafaelNadal(CocoGauff))` is true.\nBut we don't know if either of those is true for Coco Gauff *yet*.\n\nLet's try to prove `RankedHighlyWTA(CocoGauff)`.\n\nAssume for contradiction that `NOT RankedHighlyWTA(CocoGauff)`.\nFrom (1), if `NOT RankedHighlyWTA(CocoGauff)`, then `NOT MostActive(CocoGauff)`.\n\nFrom (2), `NOT RankedHighlyWTA(CocoGauff)` implies `NOT LostToIgaSwiatek(CocoGauff)`.\nFrom (3), `NOT LostToIgaSwiatek(CocoGauff)` implies `NOT FemalePlayerRG2022(CocoGauff)`.\n\nSo, if Coco Gauff is not ranked highly by WTA, then she is not a female player at RG 2022.\n\nNow consider premise 6: `(RankedHighlyWTA(CocoGauff) OR LostToRafaelNadal(CocoGauff)) -> NOT MalePlayerRG2022(CocoGauff)`.\nIf `NOT RankedHighlyWTA(CocoGauff)`, then this simplifies to `LostToRafaelNadal(CocoGauff) -> NOT MalePlayerRG2022(CocoGauff)`.\n\nWhat if Coco Gauff *is* a player at Roland Garros 2022?\nIf `PlayerRG2022(CocoGauff)` is true, then by (4), `FemalePlayerRG2022(CocoGauff) OR MalePlayerRG2022(CocoGauff)`.\nWe just showed that if `NOT RankedHighlyWTA(CocoGauff)`, then `NOT FemalePlayerRG2022(CocoGauff)`.\nSo, if `NOT RankedHighlyWTA(CocoGauff)` and `PlayerRG2022(CocoGauff)`, then `MalePlayerRG2022(CocoGauff)` must be true.\nIf `MalePlayerRG2022(CocoGauff)` is true, then by (5), `LostToRafaelNadal(CocoGauff)` is true.\nNow, if `LostToRafaelNadal(CocoGauff)` is true, let's go back to premise 6:\n`(RankedHighlyWTA(CocoGauff) OR LostToRafaelNadal(CocoGauff)) -> NOT MalePlayerRG2022(CocoGauff)`\nSince `LostToRafaelNadal(CocoGauff)` is true, the left side of this implication is true.\nThis means `NOT MalePlayerRG2022(CocoGauff)` must be true.\nThis contradicts `MalePlayerRG2022(CocoGauff)` which we derived assuming `PlayerRG2022(CocoGauff)` and `NOT RankedHighlyWTA(CocoGauff)`.\n\nTherefore, the assumption that `NOT RankedHighlyWTA(CocoGauff)` must be false, *if* Coco Gauff is a player at Roland Garros 2022.\n\nThe problem is, we don't know if Coco Gauff *is* a player at Roland Garros 2022. The premises don't state this.\nPremise 4 is `(FemalePlayerRG2022(x) OR MalePlayerRG2022(x))` for players *at* RG2022, but not that Coco Gauff is such a player.\n\nLet's re-evaluate more simply.\nWe want to prove `MostActive(CocoGauff)`.\nThis requires `RankedHighlyWTA(CocoGauff)`.\n\nCan we construct a scenario where Coco Gauff is *not* `RankedHighlyWTA`?\nIf `NOT RankedHighlyWTA(CocoGauff)`, then by (1), `NOT MostActive(CocoGauff)`.\nIf `NOT RankedHighlyWTA(CocoGauff)`, then by (2), `NOT LostToIgaSwiatek(CocoGauff)`.\nIf `NOT LostToIgaSwiatek(CocoGauff)`, then by (3), `NOT FemalePlayerRG2022(CocoGauff)`.\n\nSo, if Coco Gauff is not ranked highly by WTA, she is neither someone who lost to Iga \u015awi\u0105tek, nor a female player at RG 2022.\n\nNow consider premise 6: `(RankedHighlyWTA(CocoGauff) OR LostToRafaelNadal(CocoGauff)) -> NOT MalePlayerRG2022(CocoGauff)`.\nIf `NOT RankedHighlyWTA(CocoGauff)`, then this premise becomes:\n`LostToRafaelNadal(CocoGauff) -> NOT MalePlayerRG2022(CocoGauff)`.\n\nWhat if Coco Gauff is *not* `LostToRafaelNadal`?\nThen the antecedent of the modified premise 6 (`LostToRafaelNadal(CocoGauff)`) is false, so the premise `LostToRafaelNadal(CocoGauff) -> NOT MalePlayerRG2022(CocoGauff)` is vacuously true, and we learn nothing about `MalePlayerRG2022(CocoGauff)`.\nIn this case ( `NOT RankedHighlyWTA(CocoGauff)` AND `NOT LostToRafaelNadal(CocoGauff)` ), we have no information linking Coco Gauff to `MostActive`. We cannot conclude `MostActive(CocoGauff)`.\n\nConsider the situation where Coco Gauff is *not* a tennis player at Roland Garros 2022 at all.\nIf she is not at RG 2022, then `FemalePlayerRG2022(CocoGauff)` is false and `MalePlayerRG2022(CocoGauff)` is false.\nIn this case:\n*   (3) `FemalePlayerRG2022(CocoGauff) -> LostToIgaSwiatek(CocoGauff)` is true (antecedent is false).\n*   (5) `MalePlayerRG2022(CocoGauff) -> LostToRafaelNadal(CocoGauff)` is true (antecedent is false).\n*   (4) `PlayerRG2022(CocoGauff) -> (FemalePlayerRG2022(CocoGauff) OR MalePlayerRG2022(CocoGauff))` is not directly useful as we don't know `PlayerRG2022(CocoGauff)`.\n\nIf Coco Gauff is not at RG 2022, then we have no information that directly links her to `LostToIgaSwiatek` or `LostToRafaelNadal` unless other premises apply.\nPremise 6 is the only one that directly mentions Coco Gauff and links her to other predicates.\n\nLet's try to assume the conclusion is false: `NOT MostActive(CocoGauff)`.\nFrom (1): `NOT RankedHighlyWTA(CocoGauff)`.\n\nNow, apply `NOT RankedHighlyWTA(CocoGauff)` to premise 6:\n`(FALSE OR LostToRafaelNadal(CocoGauff)) -> NOT MalePlayerRG2022(CocoGauff)`\n`LostToRafaelNadal(CocoGauff) -> NOT MalePlayerRG2022(CocoGauff)` (P6')\n\nFrom (2): `NOT LostToIgaSwiatek(CocoGauff)`.\nFrom (3): `NOT FemalePlayerRG2022(CocoGauff)`.\n\nSo, if Coco Gauff is not `MostActive`, then she is not `RankedHighlyWTA`, not `LostToIgaSwiatek`, and not `FemalePlayerRG2022`.\n\nNow we have `NOT FemalePlayerRG2022(CocoGauff)`.\nConsider premise 4: `PlayerRG2022(CocoGauff) -> (FemalePlayerRG2022(CocoGauff) OR MalePlayerRG2022(CocoGauff))`\nIf `PlayerRG2022(CocoGauff)` is true, and `NOT FemalePlayerRG2022(CocoGauff)`, then `MalePlayerRG2022(CocoGauff)` must be true.\nIf `MalePlayerRG2022(CocoGauff)` is true, then from (5), `LostToRafaelNadal(CocoGauff)` is true.\nNow, if `LostToRafaelNadal(CocoGauff)` is true, then from (P6'), `NOT MalePlayerRG2022(CocoGauff)` is true.\nThis is a contradiction: `MalePlayerRG2022(CocoGauff)` and `NOT MalePlayerRG2022(CocoGauff)`.\n\nThis contradiction arose from the assumption `NOT MostActive(CocoGauff)` combined with `PlayerRG2022(CocoGauff)`.\nTherefore, if Coco Gauff is a player at Roland Garros 2022, then she must be `MostActive`.\n\nBut what if Coco Gauff is *not* a player at Roland Garros 2022?\nIn this case, `PlayerRG2022(CocoGauff)` is false.\nThen `FemalePlayerRG2022(CocoGauff)` is false and `MalePlayerRG2022(CocoGauff)` is false (assuming these predicates imply being a player at RG2022).\nIf `MalePlayerRG2022(CocoGauff)` is false, then premise 5 (`MalePlayerRG2022(CocoGauff) -> LostToRafaelNadal(CocoGauff)`) is vacuously true, and we don't know if `LostToRafaelNadal(CocoGauff)` is true or false.\n\nLet's re-examine:\nIf `NOT MostActive(CocoGauff)`, then `NOT RankedHighlyWTA(CocoGauff)`. (from P1)\nThis implies `NOT LostToIgaSwiatek(CocoGauff)`. (from P2)\nThis implies `NOT FemalePlayerRG2022(CocoGauff)`. (from P3)\n\nFrom P6: `(RankedHighlyWTA(CocoGauff) OR LostToRafaelNadal(CocoGauff)) -> NOT MalePlayerRG2022(CocoGauff)`.\nSince `NOT RankedHighlyWTA(CocoGauff)` is assumed, P6 becomes:\n`LostToRafaelNadal(CocoGauff) -> NOT MalePlayerRG2022(CocoGauff)` (P6')\n\nConsider a model where Coco Gauff is not `MostActive`.\n1.  `NOT MostActive(CocoGauff)` (Assumption for contradiction)\n2.  `NOT RankedHighlyWTA(CocoGauff)` (From 1 and P1)\n3.  `NOT LostToIgaSwiatek(CocoGauff)` (From 2 and P2)\n4.  `NOT FemalePlayerRG2022(CocoGauff)` (From 3 and P3)\n\nNow we need to check if this leads to a contradiction with the remaining premises (P4, P5, P6).\n\nFrom P6 and (2): `LostToRafaelNadal(CocoGauff) -> NOT MalePlayerRG2022(CocoGauff)` (P6')\n\nConsider two sub-cases for Coco Gauff:\n\n**Case A: Coco Gauff is a player at Roland Garros 2022 (`PlayerRG2022(CocoGauff)` is true).**\n    *   From P4: `FemalePlayerRG2022(CocoGauff) OR MalePlayerRG2022(CocoGauff)`\n    *   Since `NOT FemalePlayerRG2022(CocoGauff)` (from 4), it must be that `MalePlayerRG2022(CocoGauff)` is true.\n    *   From P5: `MalePlayerRG2022(CocoGauff) -> LostToRafaelNadal(CocoGauff)`. Since `MalePlayerRG2022(CocoGauff)` is true, `LostToRafaelNadal(CocoGauff)` is true.\n    *   Now, apply P6': We have `LostToRafaelNadal(CocoGauff)` is true. So, `NOT MalePlayerRG2022(CocoGauff)` must be true.\n    *   This contradicts `MalePlayerRG2022(CocoGauff)` which we derived earlier in this case.\n    *   Therefore, Case A (Coco Gauff is a player at Roland Garros 2022) is inconsistent with the assumption `NOT MostActive(CocoGauff)`.\n\n**Case B: Coco Gauff is NOT a player at Roland Garros 2022 (`PlayerRG2022(CocoGauff)` is false).**\n    *   If she is not a player at RG 2022, then `FemalePlayerRG2022(CocoGauff)` is false and `MalePlayerRG2022(CocoGauff)` is false. (This is a reasonable interpretation, if you are not a player at RG 2022, you cannot be a female/male player at RG 2022).\n    *   From 4: `NOT FemalePlayerRG2022(CocoGauff)` is consistent.\n    *   From `MalePlayerRG2022(CocoGauff)` being false:\n        *   P5 (`MalePlayerRG2022(CocoGauff) -> LostToRafaelNadal(CocoGauff)`) is vacuously true.

Yes.

This model is consistent with all premises, and `MostActive(CocoGauff)` is false.\n\nSince we found a consistent scenario (Case B) where `NOT MostActive(CocoGauff)` holds, the conclusion `MostActive(CocoGauff)` does not necessarily follow from the premises.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is Uncertain.\n\nFinal check:\nThe crucial point is whether Coco Gauff *must* be a player at Roland Garros 2022. The premises do not state this. If she is not, then P4, P3, P5 are all satisfied vacuously or don't provide a direct link to `RankedHighlyWTA` unless P6 forces it.\nIf `NOT RankedHighlyWTA(CocoGauff)` and `NOT LostToRafaelNadal(CocoGauff)`, then P6's antecedent is false, and it gives no information.\nIn this case, we have `NOT RankedHighlyWTA(CocoGauff)`, which leads to `NOT MostActive(CocoGauff)`.

This is consistent with her being a female player.\n    *   However, this path does *not* lead to `LostToRafaelNadal(CocoGauff)`. It only tells us she's not a male player.\n\n*   **Case 2: Coco Gauff is a `MaleTennisPlayerAtRG2022`.**\n    *   From P5, this implies `LostToRafaelNadal(CocoGauff)`.\n    *   If `LostToRafaelNadal(CocoGauff)` is true, then the antecedent of P6 `(RankedHighlyWTA(CocoGauff) OR LostToRafaelNadal(CocoGauff))` is true.\n    *   Therefore, from P6, `NOT MaleTennisPlayerAtRG2022(CocoGauff)` must be true.\n    *   This creates a contradiction: If Coco Gauff is a `MaleTennisPlayerAtRG2022`, then `NOT MaleTennisPlayerAtRG2022(CocoGauff)` must also be true. This is impossible.\n    *   Therefore, Coco Gauff *cannot* be a `MaleTennisPlayerAtRG2022`.\n\n*   **Combining the findings:**\n    *   We've shown that Coco Gauff cannot be a `MaleTennisPlayerAtRG2022` (because assuming she is leads to a contradiction via P5 and P6).\n    *   Since Coco Gauff cannot be a `MaleTennisPlayerAtRG2022`, and assuming she is a player at RG 2022 (P4 implies players are either male or female), she *must* be a `FemaleTennisPlayerAtRG2022`.\n    *   If `FemaleTennisPlayerAtRG2022(CocoGauff)`, then `LostToIgaSwiatek(CocoGauff)` (from P3).\n    *   If `LostToIgaSwiatek(CocoGauff)`, then `RankedHighlyWTA(CocoGauff)` (from P2).\n\n*   So, we've definitively established `RankedHighlyWTA(CocoGauff)`.\n\n*   Now look at P6 again: `(RankedHighlyWTA(CocoGauff) OR LostToRafaelNadal(CocoGauff)) -> NOT MaleTennisPlayerAtRG2022(CocoGauff)`.\n    *   We know `RankedHighlyWTA(CocoGauff)` is true. This makes the left side of the implication `(True OR LostToRafaelNadal(CocoGauff))` which is `True`.\n    *   Since the left side is true, the right side `NOT MaleTennisPlayerAtRG2022(CocoGauff)` must also be true. This is consistent with what we derived earlier.\n\n*   However, knowing that `RankedHighlyWTA(CocoGauff)` is true *does not* force `LostToRafaelNadal(CocoGauff)` to be true. The `OR` means that if one part is true, the whole disjunction is true. We have established that `RankedHighlyWTA(CocoGauff)` is true, which satisfies the condition for P6 to apply. P6 then tells us Coco Gauff is not a male player, but it doesn't give us information about her having lost to Rafael Nadal.\n\n*   Let's re-examine if there's any other path.\n    We know:\n    1. Coco Gauff is a female tennis player at RG 2022 (by elimination of male and assuming she is a player there).\n    2. Therefore, Coco Gauff lost to Iga \u015awi\u0105tek.\n    3. Therefore, Coco Gauff is ranked highly by the WTA.\n\n    The conclusion is `LostToRafaelNadal(CocoGauff)`.\n\n    From P6: `(RankedHighlyWTA(CocoGauff) OR LostToRafaelNadal(CocoGauff)) -> NOT MaleTennisPlayerAtRG2022(CocoGauff)`\n    Since `RankedHighlyWTA(CocoGauff)` is true, the antecedent of P6 is true. This leads to `NOT MaleTennisPlayerAtRG2022(CocoGauff)`. This is consistent.\n\n    But nowhere does it state that *only* male players lose to Rafael Nadal, or that all non-male players *must* have lost to Rafael Nadal. The premise `MaleTennisPlayerAtRG2022(x) -> LostToRafaelNadal(x)` is a one-way implication. It doesn't mean that `NOT MaleTennisPlayerAtRG2022(x) -> NOT LostToRafaelNadal(x)`.\n\n    We have established that Coco Gauff is a female player, lost to Iga \u015awi\u0105tek, and is ranked highly by WTA. None of these directly imply she lost to Rafael Nadal. The only way she would have lost to Rafael Nadal, based on the premises, is if she were a male tennis player at RG 2022 (P5), but we've shown she *cannot* be a male tennis player at RG 2022.\n\n    Therefore, there is no information that supports the conclusion. The information we have about Coco Gauff (female, lost to Iga, ranked highly) does not lead to her having lost to Rafael Nadal.\n\n    The statement \"Coco Gauff has lost to Rafael Nadal\" is not directly supported by the premises. In fact, if she is a female player, P5 doesn't apply to her.\n\nFinal check:\nIf Coco Gauff lost to Rafael Nadal, then from P6 (assuming she is ranked highly by WTA or lost to Rafa), she is not a male tennis player. This is consistent with her being female.\nBut the question is if she *must* have lost to Rafael Nadal.\nWe know she is ranked highly by WTA.\nP6: (RankedHighlyWTA(CocoGauff) OR LostToRafaelNadal(CocoGauff)) -> NOT MaleTennisPlayerAtRG2022(CocoGauff)\nSince RankedHighlyWTA(CocoGauff) is true, the left side of the implication is true. This means NOT MaleTennisPlayerAtRG2022(CocoGauff) is true. This is consistent.\nHowever, the truth of the left side (due to `RankedHighlyWTA(CocoGauff)`) does not force `LostToRafaelNadal(CocoGauff)` to be true.

So, `LostToRafaelNadal(CocoGauff)` is true.\nFrom P6: `(RankedHighlyWTA(CocoGauff) OR LostToRafaelNadal(CocoGauff)) => NOT MaleTennisPlayerAtRG2022(CocoGauff)`.\nSince `LostToRafaelNadal(CocoGauff)` is true, the antecedent `(RankedHighlyWTA(CocoGauff) OR LostToRafaelNadal(CocoGauff))` is true.\nThis implies `NOT MaleTennisPlayerAtRG2022(CocoGauff)`.\nThis contradicts our initial assumption `MaleTennisPlayerAtRG2022(CocoGauff)`.\nTherefore, `MaleTennisPlayerAtRG2022(CocoGauff)` must be false.\n\nWhat if Coco Gauff is not a player at Roland Garros 2022? The premises don't state she is.\nHowever, premise 6 refers to her in the context of being a player who is ranked highly by WTA or lost to Nadal. If she isn't any of these categories, the premise (6) doesn't tell us much about her gender at RG2022.\n\nLet's assume Coco Gauff *is* a tennis player. The problem is set up as a deduction about a specific person, Coco Gauff.\n\nIf Coco Gauff is not a player at Roland Garros 2022, then premise 4 is irrelevant for her.\nLet's see if we can deduce anything without assuming she is at RG2022.\n\nFrom P6: `(RankedHighlyWTA(CocoGauff) OR LostToRafaelNadal(CocoGauff)) => NOT MaleTennisPlayerAtRG2022(CocoGauff)`\n\nCan we determine if `RankedHighlyWTA(CocoGauff)` or `LostToRafaelNadal(CocoGauff)` is true or false?\nWe don't know anything directly about Coco Gauff being ranked highly by WTA or losing to Nadal.\n\nHowever, the problem is usually constructed such that all premises are relevant and lead to a definitive conclusion or uncertainty. The existence of premise (4) and (3) strongly suggests that Coco Gauff is meant to be evaluated within the context of RG2022, or at least that her being a male player at RG2022 leads to a contradiction.\n\nLet's re-confirm the assumption that \"Either female tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 or male tennis players at Roland Garros 2022\" for a *given* player means that if they are a player at RG2022, they are one or the other. This is standard interpretation.\n\nLet's stick to the deduction:\n1. Assume `MaleTennisPlayerAtRG2022(CocoGauff)`.\n2. By P5: `LostToRafaelNadal(CocoGauff)`.\n3. By P6: `(RankedHighlyWTA(CocoGauff) OR LostToRafaelNadal(CocoGauff)) => NOT MaleTennisPlayerAtRG2022(CocoGauff)`.\n4. Since `LostToRafaelNadal(CocoGauff)` is true (from step 2), the antecedent of P6 `(RankedHighlyWTA(CocoGauff) OR LostToRafaelNadal(CocoGauff))` is true.\n5. Therefore, the consequent `NOT MaleTennisPlayerAtRG2022(CocoGauff)` must be true.\n6. This contradicts assumption 1.\n7. So, `MaleTennisPlayerAtRG2022(CocoGauff)` is false.\n\nNow, we know Coco Gauff is not a male tennis player at RG2022.\nWhat about `FemaleTennisPlayerAtRG2022(CocoGauff)`?\nThe premises do not explicitly state that Coco Gauff is a player at RG2022, only that if she is one, she's either male or female.\n\nIf Coco Gauff is *not* a player at RG2022, then `MaleTennisPlayerAtRG2022(CocoGauff)` is false, and `FemaleTennisPlayerAtRG2022(CocoGauff)` is also false.\nIf `FemaleTennisPlayerAtRG2022(CocoGauff)` is false, then P3 (`FemaleTennisPlayerAtRG2022(x) => LostToIgaSwiatek(x)`) tells us nothing about `LostToIgaSwiatek(CocoGauff)`. It could be true or false.\n\nLet's consider the two possibilities for Coco Gauff:\n\n**Case 1: Coco Gauff is a `FemaleTennisPlayerAtRG2022`.**\n*   By P3: `LostToIgaSwiatek(CocoGauff)` is true.\n*   By P2: `RankedHighlyWTA(CocoGauff)` is true.\n*   By P1: `AmongMostActive(CocoGauff)` is true.\n*   In this case, `(LostToIgaSwiatek(CocoGauff) OR AmongMostActive(CocoGauff))` is true.\n*   Conclusion `NOT (LostToIgaSwiatek(CocoGauff) OR AmongMostActive(CocoGauff))` is **False**.\n\n**Case 2: Coco Gauff is NOT a `FemaleTennisPlayerAtRG2022`.**\n(This implies she is also NOT a `MaleTennisPlayerAtRG2022` as derived above, so she is just not a player at RG2022).\n*   Can we determine `LostToIgaSwiatek(CocoGauff)` or `AmongMostActive(CocoGauff)`?\n*   P3, P4, P5 are not directly applicable to her if she's not at RG2022.\n*   P1: `RankedHighlyWTA(x) => AmongMostActive(x)`\n*   P2: `LostToIgaSwiatek(x) => RankedHighlyWTA(x)`\n    *   Combining P1 and P2: `LostToIgaSwiatek(x) => AmongMostActive(x)`\n*   P6: `(RankedHighlyWTA(CocoGauff) OR LostToRafaelNadal(CocoGauff)) => NOT MaleTennisPlayerAtRG2022(CocoGauff)`\n    *   We already established `NOT MaleTennisPlayerAtRG2022(CocoGauff)` is true. So P6's consequent is true. This means P6 is always true, regardless of its antecedent's truth value. It doesn't help us determine `RankedHighlyWTA(CocoGauff)` or `LostToRafaelNadal(CocoGauff)`.\n\nSo, in Case 2, we don't know if Coco Gauff lost to Iga \u015awi\u0105tek or is among the most active players.\nFor example, Coco Gauff could be a retired player who never lost to Iga \u015awi\u0105tek and is not among the most active. In this scenario, the conclusion `NOT (LostToIgaSwiatek(CocoGauff) OR AmongMostActive(CocoGauff))` would be true.\nOr Coco Gauff could be a player who lost to Iga \u015awi\u0105tek in a non-Roland Garros tournament. Then `LostToIgaSwiatek(CocoGauff)` would be true, making the conclusion false.\n\nThe crucial point is whether we are forced to conclude that Coco Gauff is a female tennis player at RG2022.\nThe only way to reach that conclusion is if P4 implies that *all* tennis players are either male or female at RG2022, and Coco Gauff *is* a tennis player at RG2022. The premises don't state Coco Gauff is a player at RG2022.\n\nThe only strong deduction we have is `NOT MaleTennisPlayerAtRG2022(CocoGauff)`. This comes from P6 and P5.\nP6: If (Coco Gauff is ranked highly by WTA OR Coco Gauff lost to Nadal), then Coco Gauff is NOT a male tennis player at RG2022.\nP5: If Coco Gauff is a male tennis player at RG2022, then Coco Gauff lost to Nadal.\n\nLet's write it out formally for the `MaleTennisPlayerAtRG2022(CocoGauff)` contradiction:\nLet `M = MaleTennisPlayerAtRG2022(CocoGauff)`\nLet `R = RankedHighlyWTA(CocoGauff)`\nLet `L_N = LostToRafaelNadal(CocoGauff)`\n\nP5: `M => L_N`\nP6: `(R OR L_N) => NOT M`\n\nAssume `M` is true.\nFrom P5, `L_N` is true.\nThen `(R OR L_N)` becomes `(R OR True)`, which is `True`.\nFrom P6, `True => NOT M`. So `NOT M` is true.\nThis contradicts our assumption `M`.\nTherefore, `M` must be false. `NOT MaleTennisPlayerAtRG2022(CocoGauff)` is a *necessary* conclusion.\n\nSo, we know Coco Gauff is not a male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022. This is the only definitive thing we know about her specific status at RG2022.\n\nWe still don't know if she is a `FemaleTennisPlayerAtRG2022`.\nIf she is, then the conclusion is false.\nIf she is not, then we have no information from P3, P4, P5 about her having lost to Iga Swiatek or being among the most active players.\n\nLet's see if we can construct a scenario where the conclusion is true.\nAssume Coco Gauff is a player, but not a player at RG2022.\nAssume Coco Gauff has never lost to Iga Swiatek (`NOT LostToIgaSwiatek(CocoGauff)`).\nAssume Coco Gauff is not among the most active players (`NOT AmongMostActive(CocoGauff)`).\nThis would make the conclusion `NOT (LostToIgaSwiatek(CocoGauff) OR AmongMostActive(CocoGauff))` true.\nAre these assumptions consistent with the premises?\n\n1.  `NOT MaleTennisPlayerAtRG2022(CocoGauff)` (consistent, derived).\n2.  `NOT FemaleTennisPlayerAtRG2022(CocoGauff)` (consistent with not being at RG2022).\n3.  P1: `RankedHighlyWTA(x) => AmongMostActive(x)`. If `NOT AmongMostActive(CocoGauff)`, then `NOT RankedHighlyWTA(CocoGauff)`. (Consistent)\n4.  P2: `LostToIgaSwiatek(x) => RankedHighlyWTA(x)`. If `NOT RankedHighlyWTA(CocoGauff)`, then `NOT LostToIgaSwiatek(CocoGauff)`. (Consistent)\n5.  P3: `FemaleTennisPlayerAtRG2022(x) => LostToIgaSwiatek(x)`. This is true since `FemaleTennisPlayerAtRG2022(CocoGauff)` is false. (Consistent)\n6.  P4: `PlayerAtRG2022(x) => (FemaleTennisPlayerAtRG2022(x) XOR MaleTennisPlayerAtRG2022(x))`. This is true since `PlayerAtRG2022(CocoGauff)` is false. (Consistent)\n7.  P5: `MaleTennisPlayerAtRG2022(x) => LostToRafaelNadal(x)`. This is true since `MaleTennisPlayerAtRG2022(CocoGauff)` is false. (Consistent)\n8.  P6: `(RankedHighlyWTA(CocoGauff) OR LostToRafaelNadal(CocoGauff)) => NOT MaleTennisPlayerAtRG2022(CocoGauff)`.\n    *   We have `NOT RankedHighlyWTA(CocoGauff)`.\n    *   We don't know `LostToRafaelNadal(CocoGauff)`. Let's assume `NOT LostToRafaelNadal(CocoGauff)` for this scenario.\n    *   Then the antecedent `(False OR False)` is `False`.\n    *   `False => True` (since `NOT MaleTennisPlayerAtRG2022(CocoGauff)` is True) is true. (Consistent)\n\nSo, a scenario exists where Coco Gauff is not a player at RG2022, never lost to Iga Swiatek, is not among the most active players, and never lost to Rafael Nadal. In this scenario, the conclusion is True.\n\nWe already established a scenario where the conclusion is False (Coco Gauff is a Female Tennis Player at RG2022).\n\nSince we can construct a consistent world where the conclusion is true, and a consistent world where the conclusion is false, the conclusion is Uncertain.\n\nThe key here is that the premises do not force Coco Gauff to be a player *at Roland Garros 2022*. The only thing they force regarding her status at RG2022 is that she is not a *male* player.\n\nFinal check:\nIf Coco Gauff is a `FemaleTennisPlayerAtRG2022`:\nP3 => `LostToIgaSwiatek(CocoGauff)`\nP2 => `RankedHighlyWTA(CocoGauff)`\nP1 => `AmongMostActive(CocoGauff)`\nSo, `LostToIgaSwiatek(CocoGauff)` is true and `AmongMostActive(CocoGauff)` is true.\nThus, `(LostToIgaSwiatek(CocoGauff) OR AmongMostActive(CocoGauff))` is true.\nConclusion: `NOT (True)` which is `False`.\n\nIf Coco Gauff is *not* a `FemaleTennisPlayerAtRG2022` AND *not* a `MaleTennisPlayerAtRG2022` (i.e., not a player at RG2022):\n*   We know `NOT MaleTennisPlayerAtRG2022(CocoGauff)` is necessarily true.\n*   We can assume `NOT LostToIgaSwiatek(CocoGauff)` and `NOT AmongMostActive(CocoGauff)`.\n*   This is consistent if `NOT RankedHighlyWTA(CocoGauff)` (from P1) and `NOT LostToIgaSwiatek(CocoGauff)` (from P2).\n*   P6: `(RankedHighlyWTA(CocoGauff) OR LostToRafaelNadal(CocoGauff)) => NOT MaleTennisPlayerAtRG2022(CocoGauff)`\n    *   This is `(False OR LostToRafaelNadal(CocoGauff)) => True`.\n    *   This means `LostToRafaelNadal(CocoGauff) => True`, which means `LostToRafaelNadal(CocoGauff)` can be true or false.

So, Mike either has an F1 or a J1 visa.\n*   Let's consider premise 2: `InternationalStudent(x) AND HasF1Visa(x) AND WantsToWork(x) -> NeedsCPT(x) OR NeedsOPT(x)`.\n*   Let's consider premise 4: `WantsToWork(Mike) -> NeedsCPT(Mike)`.\n\nNow, let's assume Mike has a J1 visa.\nIf Mike has a J1 visa, then premise 2 (which applies to F1 visa holders) doesn't directly tell us anything about CPT/OPT requirements for J1.\nPremise 4 states `WantsToWork(Mike) -> NeedsCPT(Mike)`. This is a general statement about Mike's work requirements.\n\nThe crucial point is that premise 2 states a *condition* for needing CPT/OPT: `InternationalStudent(x) AND HasF1Visa(x) AND WantsToWork(x) -> NeedsCPT(x) OR NeedsOPT(x)`. This means if an international student with an F1 visa wants to work, they *must* apply for CPT or OPT.\n\nPremise 4 tells us that *Mike* (an international student) needs to apply for CPT *if he wants to work*.\nThis specific condition (`WantsToWork(Mike) -> NeedsCPT(Mike)`) is consistent with Mike having an F1 visa and needing CPT.\n\nHowever, premise 4 doesn't *force* Mike to have an F1 visa. It's possible that international students with J1 visas also need to apply for CPT if they want to work, and the premises don't provide information to contradict this. Premise 2 only specifies what F1 visa holders need.

If it could be both, the problem would be more complex, but typically you have one primary visa.)\n2.  `InternationalStudent(x) AND HasF1Visa(x) AND WantsToWork(x) -> (NeedsCPT(x) OR NeedsOPT(x))`\n3.  `InternationalStudent(Mike)`\n4.  `WantsToWork(Mike) -> NeedsCPT(Mike)` (This is a subtle rephrasing of \"Mike needs to apply for CPT if he wants to work in the US.\" It implies that if he wants to work, the CPT requirement applies to him.)\n\n**Conclusion:**\n`HasJ1Visa(Mike)`\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nLet's assume Mike wants to work.\n*   From (4), if `WantsToWork(Mike)`, then `NeedsCPT(Mike)`.\n*   Now consider premise (2): `InternationalStudent(x) AND HasF1Visa(x) AND WantsToWork(x) -> (NeedsCPT(x) OR NeedsOPT(x))`.\n    *   We know `InternationalStudent(Mike)` from (3).\n    *   We are assuming `WantsToWork(Mike)`.\n    *   We know `NeedsCPT(Mike)` (from our assumption and premise 4). So `(NeedsCPT(Mike) OR NeedsOPT(Mike))` is true.\n    *   This premise (2) tells us that IF Mike has an F1 visa AND wants to work, THEN he needs CPT or OPT. It doesn't say that *only* F1 visa holders need CPT/OPT.\n\nLet's consider two cases for Mike's visa based on premise (1):\n\n**Case 1: Mike has an F1 visa (`HasF1Visa(Mike)` is True)**\n*   If Mike has an F1 visa and `WantsToWork(Mike)`, then by premise (2), he `NeedsCPT(Mike)` or `NeedsOPT(Mike)`.\n*   Premise (4) states `WantsToWork(Mike) -> NeedsCPT(Mike)`. This is consistent with premise (2) if `NeedsCPT(Mike)` is true.\n*   So, if Mike has an F1 visa, and he wants to work, the conditions described in premise (4) (needing CPT) are perfectly consistent with him having an F1 visa. Therefore, we cannot conclude he *doesn't* have an F1 visa.\n\n**Case 2: Mike has a J1 visa (`HasJ1Visa(Mike)` is True)**\n*   If Mike has a J1 visa, premise (2) does not apply to him directly regarding CPT/OPT requirements, as premise (2) is specific to F1 visa holders.\n*   However, premise (4) still holds: `WantsToWork(Mike) -> NeedsCPT(Mike)`. This means that *if* Mike wants to work, he needs CPT. This statement doesn't contradict him having a J1 visa. The premises do not state that J1 visa holders *never* need CPT, or that they have different work authorization rules that would make premise (4) impossible for them. They just don't specify the work authorization rules for J1s.\n\n**Conclusion Evaluation:**\n\nThe crucial point is premise (4): `WantsToWork(Mike) -> NeedsCPT(Mike)`. This statement is about Mike's *personal requirement* if he wants to work.\n\nPremise (2) says that *F1 students* need CPT/OPT if they want to work.\nPremise (4) says *Mike* needs CPT if he wants to work.\n\nIf Mike has an F1 visa, then premise (2) explains why he might need CPT.\nIf Mike has a J1 visa, premise (2) doesn't apply. However, premise (4) is still true *about Mike*. It's possible that J1 visa holders also need CPT for certain types of work, or Mike might have some specific situation not covered by the general rules of premise (2). The premises *do not exclude* the possibility that a J1 student might also need to apply for CPT if they want to work.\n\nTherefore, the fact that Mike needs to apply for CPT if he wants to work does not *force* him to have a J1 visa. He could still have an F1 visa, and his needing CPT would be consistent with premise (2).\n\nSince Mike could logically have either an F1 or a J1 visa based on the given information, we cannot definitively conclude that he has a J1 visa.\n\nANSWER: Uncertain"], "answers": ["Uncertain"], "reference": "Uncertain", "time_total": 7.599291801452637, "time_llm": 7.598921537399292, "prompt_length": 1636}

From premise 5, we know `MatureCompanyStock(KO)`.\n2.  From premise 4, we know `MatureCompanyStock(x) -> SuitableForRetirementFund(x)`.\n3.  Therefore, by applying premise 4 to KO, we can deduce `SuitableForRetirementFund(KO)`.\n\nNow, let's look for a direct link from `MatureCompanyStock` to `CompanyStock`.\n\nThe premises state that \"KO is a *mature company's stock*\". While the term \"mature company's stock\" strongly implies it is a \"company stock\", the premises do not explicitly define \"mature company's stock\" as a *type* of \"company stock\".\n\nHowever, the common understanding of \"mature company's stock\" is that it *is* a type of \"company stock\". If something is a \"mature company's stock\", it inherently means it is a \"company stock\". This is a definitional relationship that is typically assumed in such problems unless explicitly contradicted.\n\nLet's assume the standard interpretation where `MatureCompanyStock(x)` implies `CompanyStock(x)`. If this assumption holds, then:\n\n*   Since `MatureCompanyStock(KO)` (Premise 5), and `MatureCompanyStock(x)` implies `CompanyStock(x)`, then `CompanyStock(KO)` is true.\n\nIf we strictly adhere to *only* what is explicitly stated and derived, without any common-sense inference about categories:\n\n*   Premise 3 states `Some companies\u2019 stocks are growth companies\u2019 stocks.` This tells us there *exist* company stocks, and some of them are growth company stocks. It doesn't define what a \"company stock\" *is* in a general sense, nor does it explicitly state that \"mature company's stock\" is a subset of \"company stock\".\n\nHowever, in typical FOL problems of this nature, if a term like \"X's Y\" is used (e.g., \"company's stock\"), it's generally understood that the \"X's Y\" *is* a Y. For example, \"a red car\" is a \"car\". \"A mature company's stock\" is a \"stock\". Is it a \"company stock\"? Yes, the phrase itself implies it.\n\nIf the question intended to be extremely strict, it might say \"KO is a mature company's stock, and mature company's stocks are a type of stock\" or something similar. But given the phrasing, it's a very strong implicit assumption that a \"mature company's stock\" is a \"company stock\".\n\nLet's consider if it could be False or Uncertain. Could KO be a \"mature company's stock\" but *not* a \"company stock\"? This would violate the natural interpretation of the English phrases used. If KO is a \"mature company's stock\", then it *must* be a \"company stock\". The adjective \"mature\" describes the type of company, and \"stock\" refers to the asset.\n\nTherefore, based on the natural interpretation of the language, the conclusion follows directly from the definition implied by Premise 5.\n\nANSWER: True"], "answers": ["True"], "reference": "Uncertain", "time_total": 6.0517802238464355, "time_llm": 6.05141544342041, "prompt_length": 1635}

If KO is a mature company's stock, it must be a company's stock.\nSo, `CompanyStock(KO)` is `True`.\nTherefore, `NOT CompanyStock(KO)` is `False`.\n\nSo, the consequent `(NOT CompanyStock(KO) AND NOT Volatile(KO))` is `(False AND True)`, which is `False`.\n\nSo the conclusion is `(False) -> (False)`.\nAnd `False -> False` is `True`.\n\nThe reasoning is correct.

(SJC(Mary) ^ EM(Mary)) -> (~PE(Mary) ^ ~EM(Mary))\n\nConclusion: EM(Mary)\n\nLet's assume the conclusion EM(Mary) is true and see if it leads to a contradiction, or if it must be true.\n\nFrom premise 6, if SJC(Mary) and EM(Mary) are both true, then it implies (~PE(Mary) ^ ~EM(Mary)).\nThis means (SJC(Mary) ^ EM(Mary)) -> ~EM(Mary).\nThis is a contradiction if SJC(Mary) is true, because EM(Mary) ^ ~EM(Mary) is always false.\nTherefore, for premise 6 to be true, it must be the case that the antecedent (SJC(Mary) ^ EM(Mary)) is false.\nThis means ~(SJC(Mary) ^ EM(Mary)), which is equivalent to ~SJC(Mary) V ~EM(Mary).\n\nSo, from premise 6, we know that either Mary does not work in student jobs on campus, or Mary does not need to earn money to help pay for her college tuition.\n\nNow let's consider the initial part of the premises:\nFrom (2) OTF(x) -> SJC(x)\nFrom (1) SJC(x) -> EM(x)\nBy transitivity, OTF(x) -> EM(x).\n\nFrom (3) OTF(Mary) V EDH(Mary).\n\nCase 1: OTF(Mary) is true.\nIf OTF(Mary) is true, then from OTF(Mary) -> EM(Mary), we get EM(Mary).\nAlso, if OTF(Mary) is true, then SJC(Mary) is true (from premise 2).\nSo, if OTF(Mary) is true, then SJC(Mary) is true and EM(Mary) is true.\nBut we derived from premise 6 that ~(SJC(Mary) ^ EM(Mary)).\nSo, this case (OTF(Mary) is true) leads to a contradiction.\nTherefore, OTF(Mary) must be false.\n\nCase 2: OTF(Mary) is false.\nSince OTF(Mary) V EDH(Mary) (premise 3), and OTF(Mary) is false, then EDH(Mary) must be true.\nIf EDH(Mary) is true, then from premise 4, ~PE(Mary) is true (Mary is not a picky eater).\nAnd from premise 5, STEC(Mary) is true (Mary spends a lot of her time eating and catching up with friends in the campus dining halls).\n\nNow, we have EDH(Mary) is true, ~PE(Mary) is true, STEC(Mary) is true.\nWe also know from premise 6 that ~(SJC(Mary) ^ EM(Mary)), which means ~SJC(Mary) V ~EM(Mary).\n\nCan we determine if EM(Mary) is true or false?\nIf EDH(Mary) is true, does it tell us anything about SJC(Mary) or EM(Mary)?\nThe premises (1) and (2) connect to SJC(x) and EM(x) via OTF(x).\nSince OTF(Mary) is false, we cannot use (2) to infer SJC(Mary). We don't know if SJC(Mary) is true or false.\n\nIf SJC(Mary) is true:\nThen from premise 1, EM(Mary) must be true.\nIf SJC(Mary) is true and EM(Mary) is true, then from premise 6, we get (~PE(Mary) ^ ~EM(Mary)).\nThis would mean EM(Mary) and ~EM(Mary), which is a contradiction.\nTherefore, SJC(Mary) cannot be true.\n\nSince SJC(Mary) cannot be true, then SJC(Mary) must be false.\nIf SJC(Mary) is false, then the antecedent of premise 1 (SJC(Mary) -> EM(Mary)) is false, so it tells us nothing about EM(Mary).\nAlso, if SJC(Mary) is false, then the antecedent of premise 6 (SJC(Mary) ^ EM(Mary)) is false, so it tells us nothing about EM(Mary) either (the implication is true regardless of EM(Mary)'s truth value).\n\nSo, we have established:\n1. OTF(Mary) is false.\n2. EDH(Mary) is true.\n3. ~PE(Mary) is true.\n4. STEC(Mary) is true.\n5. SJC(Mary) is false.\n\nThe conclusion is EM(Mary).\nWe know SJC(Mary) is false.\nPremise 1 is SJC(x) -> EM(x).\nSince SJC(Mary) is false, the implication SJC(Mary) -> EM(Mary) is true regardless of the truth value of EM(Mary). It doesn't force EM(Mary) to be true or false.\n\nWe have exhausted all logical derivations from the premises.\nWe know SJC(Mary) is false. This makes the first part of the antecedent of premise 6 false, so the entire antecedent (SJC(Mary) ^ EM(Mary)) is false. This means premise 6 is true regardless of the truth value of EM(Mary).\n\nTherefore, based on the premises, we cannot definitively conclude whether EM(Mary) is true or false.\n\nThe derivation:\n1. Assume (SJC(Mary) ^ EM(Mary)).\n2. From (1) and P6: (~PE(Mary) ^ ~EM(Mary)).\n3. From (2): EM(Mary) ^ ~EM(Mary). Contradiction.\n4. Therefore, the assumption in (1) must be false: ~(SJC(Mary) ^ EM(Mary)), which is equivalent to ~SJC(Mary) V ~EM(Mary).\n\n5. From P2: OTF(Mary) -> SJC(Mary).\n6. From P1: SJC(Mary) -> EM(Mary).\n7. From (5) and (6): OTF(Mary) -> EM(Mary).\n\n8. Assume OTF(Mary).\n9. From (8) and (5): SJC(Mary).\n10. From (8) and (7): EM(Mary).\n11. From (9) and (10): (SJC(Mary) ^ EM(Mary)).\n12.

From P4: EDH(Mary) -> ~PE(Mary).\n17. From (15) and (16): ~PE(Mary).\n\n18. From P5: EDH(Mary) -> STEC(Mary).\n19. From (15) and (18): STEC(Mary).\n\nNow we know:\n~OTF(Mary)\nEDH(Mary)\n~PE(Mary)\nSTEC(Mary)\nAnd ~SJC(Mary) V ~EM(Mary) (from step 4)\n\nWe need to evaluate EM(Mary).\nSince ~OTF(Mary) (step 13), P2 (OTF(Mary) -> SJC(Mary)) does not force SJC(Mary) to be true.\nWe don't know if SJC(Mary) is true or false from the other premises directly.\n\nLet's reconsider step 4: ~SJC(Mary) V ~EM(Mary).\nIf EM(Mary) were true, then from ~SJC(Mary) V ~EM(Mary), it would imply ~SJC(Mary).\nLet's see if we can derive EM(Mary) or ~EM(Mary).\n\nIf EM(Mary) is true:\nThen from ~SJC(Mary) V ~EM(Mary), we get ~SJC(Mary).\nThis is consistent with the premises. We have SJC(Mary) is false, EM(Mary) is true.\nPremise 1: SJC(Mary) -> EM(Mary) (F -> T is T) - Consistent.\nPremise 6: (SJC(Mary) ^ EM(Mary)) -> (~PE(Mary) ^ ~EM(Mary))\n(F ^ T) -> (~PE(Mary) ^ ~T)\nF -> (~PE(Mary) ^ F)\nF -> F (This is true) - Consistent.\n\nIf EM(Mary) is false:\nThen from ~SJC(Mary) V ~EM(Mary), we get ~SJC(Mary) V T, which is T. This doesn't help.\nHowever, if EM(Mary) is false, then we have:\nSJC(Mary) is unknown.\nPremise 1: SJC(Mary) -> EM(Mary) becomes SJC(Mary) -> F.\nFor this to be true, SJC(Mary) must be false. So, if EM(Mary) is false, then SJC(Mary) must be false.\nPremise 6: (SJC(Mary) ^ EM(Mary)) -> (~PE(Mary) ^ ~EM(Mary))\n(F ^ F) -> (~PE(Mary) ^ T)\nF -> (~PE(Mary)) (This is true) - Consistent.\n\nSince we can construct a scenario where EM(Mary) is true (SJC(Mary) is false, EM(Mary) is true) and it is consistent with all premises, and we can construct a scenario where EM(Mary) is false (SJC(Mary) is false, EM(Mary) is false) and it is consistent with all premises, the conclusion is Uncertain.\n\nFinal check of the reasoning:\n1. From P6: (SJC(M) ^ EM(M)) -> (~PE(M) ^ ~EM(M)).\n   If the antecedent (SJC(M) ^ EM(M)) is true, then EM(M) and ~EM(M) must be true, which is a contradiction.\n   Therefore, the antecedent must be false: ~(SJC(M) ^ EM(M)), which means ~SJC(M) V ~EM(M).\n\n2. From P2: OTF(M) -> SJC(M).\n3. From P1: SJC(M) -> EM(M).\n4. From P2 and P1: OTF(M) -> EM(M).\n\n5. Assume OTF(M) is true.\n   Then from (4), EM(M) is true.\n   Then from (2), SJC(M) is true.\n   So (SJC(M) ^ EM(M)) is true.\n   But from (1), we know ~(SJC(M) ^ EM(M)). This is a contradiction.\n   Therefore, the assumption in (5) must be false: ~OTF(M).\n\n6. From P3: OTF(M) V EDH(M).\n   Since ~OTF(M) (from 5), then EDH(M) must be true.\n\n7. From P4: EDH(M) -> ~PE(M). Since EDH(M) is true (from 6), then ~PE(M) is true. (Mary is not a picky eater).\n8. From P5: EDH(M) -> STEC(M). Since EDH(M) is true (from 6), then STEC(M) is true. (Mary spends a lot of time eating and catching up with friends in the campus dining halls).\n\nNow we have:\nA. ~OTF(M)\nB. EDH(M)\nC. ~PE(M)\nD. STEC(M)\nE. ~SJC(M) V ~EM(M) (from step 1)\n\nWe need to evaluate EM(M).\n\nConsider Premise 1: SJC(M) -> EM(M).\nConsider Premise 2: OTF(M) -> SJC(M). We know ~OTF(M), so this premise is satisfied regardless of SJC(M).\n\nWe don't have any direct information that forces SJC(M) to be true or false.\nHowever, let's use E: ~SJC(M) V ~EM(M).\n\nScenario 1: EM(M) is True.\nIf EM(M) is true, then from E, ~SJC(M) must be true.\nSo, in this scenario: EM(M) is T, SJC(M) is F.\nCheck consistency with premises:\nP1: SJC(M) -> EM(M) becomes F -> T, which is True. (Consistent)\nP6: (SJC(M) ^ EM(M)) -> (~PE(M) ^ ~EM(M)) becomes (F ^ T) -> (~PE(M) ^ F), which is F -> F, which is True. (Consistent)\nAll other premises are about OTF, EDH, PE, STEC, which we've already deduced consistently.\n\nScenario 2: EM(M) is False.\nIf EM(M) is false, then from E, ~SJC(M) V T, which is True. This doesn't force ~SJC(M), but it doesn't contradict it either.\nHowever, let's check P1 again: SJC(M) -> EM(M).\nIf EM(M) is False, then for P1 to be True, SJC(M) must be False (T -> F is False, F -> F is True).\nSo, in this scenario: EM(M) is F, SJC(M) is F.\nCheck consistency with premises:\nP1: SJC(M) -> EM(M) becomes F -> F, which is True. (Consistent)\nP6: (SJC(M) ^ EM(M)) -> (~PE(M) ^ ~EM(M)) becomes (F ^ F) -> (~PE(M) ^ T), which is F -> (~PE(M)), which is True. (Consistent)\n\nSince both scenarios (EM(M) is True with SJC(M) being False, and EM(M) is False with SJC(M) being False) are consistent with all premises, we cannot definitively determine the truth value of EM(Mary).\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is Uncertain.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{Uncertain}$"], "answers": ["Uncertain"], "reference": "Uncertain", "time_total": 17.872657775878906, "time_llm": 17.871849060058594, "prompt_length": 2118}

So P6 is logically `True`.\n\nLet's re-examine this. P6 essentially states that Mary cannot simultaneously work a student job and need money. If she does, then she doesn't need money (a contradiction). This means the only way for P6 to hold true is if `NOT (StudentJob(Mary) AND NeedsMoney(Mary))` is always true.\nSo, P6 simplifies to `NOT StudentJob(Mary) OR NOT NeedsMoney(Mary)`.\n\nNow, let's use this insight.\n\nFrom P1: `StudentJob(Mary) -> NeedsMoney(Mary)`\nThis means `NOT StudentJob(Mary) OR NeedsMoney(Mary)`.\n\nWe have:\n1. `NOT StudentJob(Mary) OR NeedsMoney(Mary)` (from P1)\n2. `NOT StudentJob(Mary) OR NOT NeedsMoney(Mary)` (from P6's implication being true only if its antecedent is false)\n\nLet's combine these two.\nIf `StudentJob(Mary)` is true:\n*   From (1), `NeedsMoney(Mary)` must be true.\n*   From (2), `NOT NeedsMoney(Mary)` must be true.\n*   This is a contradiction (`NeedsMoney(Mary) AND NOT NeedsMoney(Mary)`).\nTherefore, `StudentJob(Mary)` must be false.\n\nSince `StudentJob(Mary)` is false:\n*   From P2 (`OrdersTakeout(Mary) -> StudentJob(Mary)`), if `StudentJob(Mary)` is false, then `OrdersTakeout(Mary)` must also be false (because if `OrdersTakeout(Mary)` were true, then `StudentJob(Mary)` would be true).\nSo, `NOT OrdersTakeout(Mary)`.\n\nNow we use P3: `OrdersTakeout(Mary) OR EnjoysDiningHall(Mary)`.\nSince `NOT OrdersTakeout(Mary)` is true, then `EnjoysDiningHall(Mary)` must be true.\n\nNow we have `EnjoysDiningHall(Mary)`. Let's use this with P4 and P5:\n*   From P4: `EnjoysDiningHall(Mary) -> NOT PickyEater(Mary)`. Since `EnjoysDiningHall(Mary)` is true, then `NOT PickyEater(Mary)` is true.\n*   From P5: `EnjoysDiningHall(Mary) -> SpendsTimeEating(Mary)`. Since `EnjoysDiningHall(Mary)` is true, then `SpendsTimeEating(Mary)` is true.\n\nSo, we have deduced:\n1.  `NOT PickyEater(Mary)`\n2.  `SpendsTimeEating(Mary)`\n\nThe conclusion is `NOT PickyEater(Mary) OR SpendsTimeEating(Mary)`.\nSince `NOT PickyEater(Mary)` is true, the disjunction `NOT PickyEater(Mary) OR SpendsTimeEating(Mary)` is true.\n\nThe unusual nature of P6 is key.

Analyze Premise 6: `(StudentJob(Mary) AND NeedsMoney(Mary)) -> (NOT PickyEater(Mary) AND NOT NeedsMoney(Mary))`\n    *   The consequent `(NOT PickyEater(Mary) AND NOT NeedsMoney(Mary))` implies `NOT NeedsMoney(Mary)`.\n    *   If the antecedent `(StudentJob(Mary) AND NeedsMoney(Mary))` is true, then `NeedsMoney(Mary)` is true (from the antecedent) AND `NOT NeedsMoney(Mary)` is true (from the consequent). This is a contradiction.\n    *   Therefore, the antecedent `(StudentJob(Mary) AND NeedsMoney(Mary))` must always be false for Premise 6 to be consistent (i.e., not lead to a contradiction if it were true).\n    *   So, `NOT (StudentJob(Mary) AND NeedsMoney(Mary))` is true, which means `NOT StudentJob(Mary) OR NOT NeedsMoney(Mary)`.\n\n2.  Combine with Premise 1: `StudentJob(Mary) -> NeedsMoney(Mary)`, which is `NOT StudentJob(Mary) OR NeedsMoney(Mary)`.\n\n3.  We have:\n    *   `NOT StudentJob(Mary) OR NeedsMoney(Mary)` (from P1)\n    *   `NOT StudentJob(Mary) OR NOT NeedsMoney(Mary)` (from P6's implications for consistency)\n    *   Assume `StudentJob(Mary)` is true.\n        *   From P1, `NeedsMoney(Mary)` must be true.\n        *   From P6's implication, `NOT NeedsMoney(Mary)` must be true.\n        *   This is a contradiction.\n    *   Therefore, the assumption `StudentJob(Mary)` is true must be false.\n    *   So, `NOT StudentJob(Mary)` is true.\n\n4.  From `NOT StudentJob(Mary)` and Premise 2: `OrdersTakeout(Mary) -> StudentJob(Mary)`.\n    *   Since `StudentJob(Mary)` is false, and `A -> B` is equivalent to `NOT B -> NOT A`, then `NOT StudentJob(Mary) -> NOT OrdersTakeout(Mary)`.\n    *   Therefore, `NOT OrdersTakeout(Mary)` is true.\n\n5.  From `NOT OrdersTakeout(Mary)` and Premise 3: `OrdersTakeout(Mary) OR EnjoysDiningHall(Mary)`.\n    *   Since `OrdersTakeout(Mary)` is false, then `EnjoysDiningHall(Mary)` must be true.\n\n6.  From `EnjoysDiningHall(Mary)` and Premise 4: `EnjoysDiningHall(Mary) -> NOT PickyEater(Mary)`.\n    *   Therefore, `NOT PickyEater(Mary)` is true.\n\n7.  From `EnjoysDiningHall(Mary)` and Premise 5: `EnjoysDiningHall(Mary) -> SpendsTimeEating(Mary)`.\n    *   Therefore, `SpendsTimeEating(Mary)` is true.\n\n8.

If they are spicy, they cannot be a bakery.\n\nConsider the antecedent of Premise 5: `(Spicy(DriedThaiChilies) or Bakery(DriedThaiChilies))` (P or Q).\nSince `Q -> not P`, if Q is true, P must be false. If P is true, Q must be false.\nSo, `P or Q` means exactly one of P or Q is true.\n\nConsider the consequent of Premise 5: `(Hotpot(DriedThaiChilies) or Spicy(DriedThaiChilies))` (R or P).\n\nLet's analyze cases for Dried Thai Chilies:\n\nCase 1: `Spicy(DriedThaiChilies)` is true (P is true).\nIf P is true, then from Premise 1, `Bakery(DriedThaiChilies)` (Q) must be false.\nSo, the antecedent of Premise 5 `(P or Q)` becomes `(True or False)` which is `True`.\nSince the antecedent is true, the consequent `(R or P)` must be true.\n`(Hotpot(DriedThaiChilies) or Spicy(DriedThaiChilies))` becomes `(R or True)`, which is `True`.

It doesn't directly tell us anything *definitive* about Dried Thai chilies being cupcakes or products of Baked by Melissa.\n\nLet's analyze what we *do* know:\n*   \"All cupcakes are bakeries.\" (Premise 2)\n*   \"No bakery is spicy.\" (Premise 1)\n    *   From these two, we can infer: No cupcake is spicy.\n*   \"All hotpots are spicy.\" (Premise 3)\n*   \"All products of Baked by Melissa are cupcakes.\" (Premise 4)\n    *   From this and \"All cupcakes are bakeries\", we can infer: All products of Baked by Melissa are bakeries.\n    *   From this and \"No bakery is spicy\", we can infer: No product of Baked by Melissa is spicy.\n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion: \"Dried Thai chilies are cupcakes and a product of Baked by Melissa.\"\n\nIf Dried Thai chilies *were* cupcakes (and thus products of Baked by Melissa), then based on our inferences above, Dried Thai chilies would *not* be spicy.\n\nHowever, Premise 5 states: \"If dried Thai chilies are spicy or a bakery, then dried Thai chilies are a hotpot or are spicy.\"\nThis premise gives us a relationship but doesn't assert the truth of the antecedent or consequent.\n\nWe have no information that directly states Dried Thai chilies *are* cupcakes or products of Baked by Melissa. The premises do not provide any facts about the inherent nature of \"Dried Thai chilies\" other than how they might relate to \"spicy\", \"bakery\", or \"hotpot\" via a conditional statement.\n\nFor example, Dried Thai chilies are typically spicy. If they *are* spicy, then according to Premise 5, they must be a hotpot or spicy (which is consistent). But if they are spicy, they cannot be cupcakes or products of Baked by Melissa, because cupcakes and products of Baked by Melissa are *not* spicy.\n\nLet's assume the conclusion is true: Dried Thai chilies are cupcakes and a product of Baked by Melissa.\nIf this is true, then:\n1.  Dried Thai chilies are cupcakes (from conclusion).\n2.  All cupcakes are bakeries (Premise 2) => Dried Thai chilies are bakeries.\n3.  No bakery is spicy (Premise 1) => Dried Thai chilies are not spicy.\n\nNow let's check Premise 5 with this assumption:\n\"If dried Thai chilies are spicy (False) or a bakery (True), then dried Thai chilies are a hotpot (Unknown) or are spicy (False).\"\nThis simplifies to: \"If True, then (Unknown or False)\" which means \"If True, then Unknown\".\nThis means the consequent (Dried Thai chilies are a hotpot or are spicy) must be true for the premise to hold, given the antecedent is true. Since Dried Thai chilies are not spicy, for the consequent to be true, Dried Thai chilies must be a hotpot.\nHowever, if Dried Thai chilies are a hotpot, then from Premise 3 (\"All hotpots are spicy\"), Dried Thai chilies must be spicy.\nThis creates a contradiction: if Dried Thai chilies are cupcakes, they are not spicy. But if they are a hotpot (which they must be for Premise 5 to hold under the assumption), they *are* spicy. Therefore, Dried Thai chilies cannot be both cupcakes and hotpots.\n\nThis means our assumption that \"Dried Thai chilies are cupcakes and a product of Baked by Melissa\" leads to a contradiction if we assume Dried Thai chilies fulfill the conditions of Premise 5 in a way that makes the antecedent true (e.g., if they are bakeries).\n\nThe conclusion *asserts* a specific state for Dried Thai chilies. The premises do not provide any direct information to affirm this assertion. In fact, if Dried Thai chilies are spicy (which they typically are), then they cannot be cupcakes or products of Baked by Melissa. The premises give no information that Dried Thai chilies are *not* spicy.\n\nTherefore, we cannot deduce the conclusion from the premises.\n\nThe premises do not provide enough information to confirm that Dried Thai chilies are cupcakes or products of Baked by Melissa. There is no rule that says \"Dried Thai chilies are X\". The fifth premise is a conditional and doesn't assert the truth of its components.\n\nFinal check:\nIs it possible for the premises to be true and the conclusion to be false? Yes. For example, Dried Thai chilies could simply be spicy and not related to cupcakes or Baked by Melissa at all. This would be consistent with all premises.\nIs it possible for the premises to be true and the conclusion to be true? We don't have enough information to confirm this. The logical structure doesn't force it.\n\nThe information given is about categories (bakery, cupcake, hotpot, spicy, product of Baked by Melissa) and their relationships. \"Dried Thai chilies\" is treated as an individual. Premise 5 is the only one mentioning \"Dried Thai chilies\", and it's a conditional.

This means \"Subway's rating is greater than 9 AND Subway does NOT provide take-out service.\"\n\nHowever, the antecedent is (P AND Q), which means \"Subway provides take-out service AND Subway receives many negative reviews.\"\n\nSo, the conclusion is: (Subway provides take-out service AND Subway receives many negative reviews) THEN (Subway's rating is greater than 9 AND Subway does NOT provide take-out service).\n\nThe antecedent states \"Subway provides take-out service\" (P), while the consequent states \"Subway does NOT provide take-out service\" (NOT P).\nThis means the consequent (R AND NOT P) contains a direct contradiction to part of the antecedent (P AND Q).\n\nFor a conditional statement \"If A then B\" to be true, if A is true, then B must also be true.\nIf the antecedent (P AND Q) is true, then P is true.\nBut if the consequent (R AND NOT P) is true, then NOT P must be true.\nIt's impossible for P to be true AND NOT P to be true simultaneously. Therefore, the consequent (R AND NOT P) can never be true if P is true.\n\nThis means if the antecedent (P AND Q) is true, the consequent (R AND NOT P) must be false.\nIn such a case (True antecedent -> False consequent), the entire conditional statement \"If A then B\" is False.\n\n**Conclusion Evaluation (independent of premises):**\nThe conclusion itself is a logical contradiction. If \"Subway provides take-out service\" is true (as stated in the antecedent), then \"Subway does not provide take-out service\" (as stated in the consequent) must be false. A statement \"A AND NOT A\" is always false. Therefore, the consequent \"(its rating is greater than 9 AND it does not provide take-out service)\" can never be true if the first part of the antecedent (\"Subway provides take-out service\") is true.\n\nA conditional statement \"If X then Y\" is only false if X is true and Y is false.\nHere, if X (Subway provides take-out service AND receives many negative reviews) is true, then the first part \"Subway provides take-out service\" is true.\nBut if Y (Subway's rating is greater than 9 AND it does not provide take-out service) is true, then \"Subway does not provide take-out service\" must be true.\nThis creates a situation where \"Subway provides take-out service\" must be both true and false simultaneously, which is impossible.\n\nTherefore, the only way for the entire conclusion \"If (P AND Q) then (R AND NOT P)\" to be logically valid is if the antecedent (P AND Q) is always false, or if the structure is considered vacuously true in a specific context. However, as a statement about the world, if the antecedent *can* be true, the conclusion is problematic.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the logical structure.\nThe statement is: (A AND B) -> (C AND NOT A)\nIf (A AND B) is true, then A is true.\nFor (A AND B) -> (C AND NOT A) to be true, it must be that if (A AND B) is true, then (C AND NOT A) is true.\nBut if A is true, then NOT A is false.\nIf NOT A is false, then (C AND NOT A) is false.\nSo, if (A AND B) is true, then (C AND NOT A) is false.\nThis means (True -> False), which makes the entire conditional statement FALSE.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"If Subway provides take-out service and receives many negative reviews, then its rating is greater than 9 and it does not provide take-out service\" is *always false* due to its internal logical inconsistency, regardless of the premises. The antecedent asserts P, and the consequent asserts NOT P, making the statement logically contradictory if the antecedent is true.\n\n**No need to use the premises:**\nSince the conclusion itself contains a logical contradiction in its structure (specifically, if the antecedent is true, the consequent must be false), the conclusion is always false. The premises are irrelevant to determining the truth value of this self-contradictory statement.\n\nFinal check:\nLet A = \"Subway provides take-out service\"\nLet B = \"Subway receives many negative reviews\"\nLet C = \"Subway's rating is greater than 9\"\n\nThe conclusion is: (A AND B) -> (C AND NOT A)\n\nAssume the antecedent (A AND B) is true.\nThis implies A is true.\nNow, consider the consequent (C AND NOT A).\nSince A is true, NOT A must be false.\nIf NOT A is false, then (C AND NOT A) must be false (because \"False AND anything\" is False).\nSo, we have: If (A AND B) is true, then (C AND NOT A) is false.\nThis means: True -> False.\nA conditional statement (P -> Q) is false if and only if P is true and Q is false.\nHere, P = (A AND B) and Q = (C AND NOT A).\nWe showed that if P is true, then Q must be false.\nTherefore, the entire statement (A AND B) -> (C AND NOT A) is False.\n\nThe conclusion is demonstrably false based purely on its internal logical structure.\n\nANSWER: False"], "answers": ["False"], "reference": "Uncertain", "time_total": 8.212534189224243, "time_llm": 8.212100744247437, "prompt_length": 1927}

This is known as the fallacy of affirming the consequent.\nFor example, \"If it rains (P), the ground is wet (Q)\". This doesn't mean \"If the ground is wet (Q), it must have rained (P)\" (it could have been watered).\n\nHowever, in this specific context, the phrase \"become smarter\" implies a change from a state of not being smarter to being smarter, and the only cause for becoming smarter mentioned in the premises is gaining knowledge. While the premise is stated as a conditional, in the context of the given information, becoming smarter is presented *as a result* of gaining knowledge.\n\nLet's re-examine Premise 3: \"If a person gains knowledge, they become smarter.\"\nThis premise establishes a one-way causal relationship from gaining knowledge to becoming smarter. It does not state that gaining knowledge is the *only* way to become smarter.\n\nHowever, the conclusion \"A person who is smarter has gained knowledge\" implies that gaining knowledge is a *necessary condition* for being smarter.\n\nLet's consider a scenario where the conclusion is false: A person is smarter, but they did *not* gain knowledge.\nIf this were possible, it would contradict the spirit of premise 3, which links becoming smarter directly to gaining knowledge. While premise 3 is an \"if-then\" statement, in the context of typical understanding and the other premises (especially \"[BG] When a person reads a book, that person gains knowledge. [BG] If a person gains knowledge, they become smarter.\"), the implication is that gaining knowledge is the mechanism for becoming smarter.\n\nIf someone *is* smarter, it implies they *became* smarter. And the only mechanism provided in the premises for *becoming* smarter is *gaining knowledge*.\n\nLet's look at it contrapositively.\nPremise 3: If P (gains knowledge), then Q (becomes smarter).\nThe contrapositive is: If not Q (does not become smarter), then not P (does not gain knowledge). This is logically equivalent to Premise 3.\n\nThe conclusion is \"If Q (is smarter), then P (has gained knowledge)\". This is affirming the consequent, which is not logically valid *in general*.\n\nHowever, let's consider the phrasing \"A person who *is* smarter\". This implies they reached that state. How do they reach that state according to the premises? Only by gaining knowledge. If there were another way to become smarter not involving gaining knowledge, the premises do not mention it. In a closed world assumption, if the premises describe the mechanisms, then this inference holds.\n\nConsider the common sense interpretation of these statements:\n1. Knowledge leads to becoming smarter.\n2. The conclusion implies that if someone is smarter, they must have acquired knowledge.\n\nIf someone *is* smarter, it means they *became* smarter at some point. According to the rules given, the *only* way to \"become smarter\" is to \"gain knowledge\". Therefore, if they \"are smarter\", they must have undergone the process of \"gaining knowledge\".\n\nLet's assume the conclusion is false: There exists a person who *is smarter* but *has not gained knowledge*.\nAccording to Premise 3 (\"If a person gains knowledge, they become smarter.\"), this person did not gain knowledge. Yet they *are* smarter. This means they became smarter *without* gaining knowledge. This contradicts the implication of Premise 3 that gaining knowledge is the pathway to becoming smarter. While Premise 3 is an \"if-then\", in the context of defining how one becomes smarter, it acts as the sole described mechanism.\n\nTherefore, under the reasonable interpretation that the premises define the relevant mechanisms for becoming smarter, the conclusion follows.\nThe phrasing \"become smarter\" suggests a change of state. If one *is* in the state of being smarter, it implies they *became* smarter. The only way to *become* smarter, according to the premises, is by gaining knowledge.\n\nFinal decision: The conclusion holds given the implied causal structure within the premises.\nThe premises establish gaining knowledge as the *cause* for becoming smarter. If someone *is* smarter, it implies that the cause must have occurred.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is True."], "answers": ["True"], "reference": "Uncertain", "time_total": 7.233140707015991, "time_llm": 7.23288631439209, "prompt_length": 1588}

From (6), we know `Gentleman(Harry)`.\n2.  From (4) and (1), if `Gentleman(Harry)`, then `Handsome(Harry)`. So, `Handsome(Harry)`.\n3.  From (2), if `Ugly(x)`, then `NOT Handsome(x)`. Since `Handsome(Harry)` (from step 2), it must be that `NOT Ugly(Harry)`.\n4.  From (3), if `Evil(x)`, then `Ugly(x)`. Since `NOT Ugly(Harry)` (from step 3), it must be that `NOT Evil(Harry)`. (This is the contrapositive: `NOT Ugly(x) => NOT Evil(x)`)\n5.  Now we need to consider Harry being a man. The premises don't explicitly state that Harry is a man. However, the term \"gentleman\" strongly implies being a man. If we assume `Gentleman(x) => Man(x)`, then from `Gentleman(Harry)`, we get `Man(Harry)`.\n6.  If `Man(Harry)` (from step 5), then from (1), `Kind(Harry) OR Evil(Harry)`.\n7.  We know `NOT Evil(Harry)` (from step 4).\n8.  Combining step 6 and 7, if `Kind(Harry) OR Evil(Harry)` and `NOT Evil(Harry)`, then it must be `Kind(Harry)`.\n\nTherefore, we have derived `Kind(Harry)`.\n\nThe conclusion states `Kind(Harry) OR CEO(Harry)`. Since we have derived `Kind(Harry)`, the disjunction `Kind(Harry) OR CEO(Harry)` is true.\n\n**Important Assumption:** The crucial implicit assumption is that \"gentleman\" implies \"man\". If this assumption is not made, the conclusion cannot be definitively proven. However, in typical FOL problems of this nature, common-sense implications like \"gentleman is a man\" are usually intended.\n\nLet's re-evaluate without assuming `Gentleman(x) => Man(x)`:\n\n*   We know `Gentleman(Harry)` (6).\n*   From (4), `Handsome(Harry)`.\n*   From (2) and (3) (contrapositive of 3: `NOT Ugly(x) => NOT Evil(x)`, and contrapositive of 2: `Handsome(x) => NOT Ugly(x)`), we get `Handsome(x) => NOT Evil(x)`. So, `NOT Evil(Harry)`.\n*   The premise (1) `Man(x) => Kind(x) OR Evil(x)` only applies if we know Harry is a man.\n\nIf Harry is *not* a man, then premise (1) doesn't apply to him, and we cannot deduce `Kind(Harry)`. For example, Harry could be a handsome, non-man entity for whom `Kind` and `Evil` are not defined by premise (1).\n\nHowever, the common usage of \"gentleman\" *does* imply \"man\". If we interpret \"gentleman\" as a specific type of man, then the conclusion holds. If \"gentleman\" is just an abstract property that could apply to anything, then the conclusion is uncertain. Given the context of these types of logic problems, it's highly probable that \"gentleman\" implies \"man\".\n\nLet's assume `Gentleman(x) => Man(x)`.\n\n1.  `Gentleman(Harry)` (Premise 6)\n2.  `Man(Harry)` (From 1 and assumption `Gentleman(x) => Man(x)`)\n3.  `Handsome(Harry)` (From 1 and Premise 4)\n4.  `NOT Ugly(Harry)` (From 3 and Premise 2: `Ugly(x) => NOT Handsome(x)`, so `Handsome(x) => NOT Ugly(x)`)\n5.  `NOT Evil(Harry)` (From 4 and Premise 3: `Evil(x) => Ugly(x)`, so `NOT Ugly(x) => NOT Evil(x)`)\n6.  `Kind(Harry) OR Evil(Harry)` (From 2 and Premise 1)\n7.  Since `NOT Evil(Harry)` (from 5) and `Kind(Harry) OR Evil(Harry)` (from 6), it must be `Kind(Harry)`.\n8.  The conclusion is `Kind(Harry) OR CEO(Harry)`. Since `Kind(Harry)` is true, the disjunction is true.\n\nIf we do *not* assume `Gentleman(x) => Man(x)`:\n\nWe know `NOT Evil(Harry)` from the chain: `Gentleman(Harry) -> Handsome(Harry) -> NOT Ugly(Harry) -> NOT Evil(Harry)`.\nHowever, we cannot say anything about `Kind(Harry)` because premise 1 (`Man(x) => Kind(x) OR Evil(x)`) only applies to men. If Harry is not a man, he could be anything (e.g., a well-behaved robot) and premise 1 would not apply. In this case, `Kind(Harry)` would be unknown. Since `CEO(Harry)` is also unknown (we only know `Gentleman(Harry)`, not `CEO(Harry)`), the disjunction `Kind(Harry) OR CEO(Harry)` would be uncertain.\n\nHowever, the problem setup \"A man is either kind or evil\" and \"Harry is a gentleman\" in a natural language context strongly implies that Harry is a man. It would be an excessively pedantic interpretation to assume \"gentleman\" does not imply \"man\" in this context.\n\nAssuming `Gentleman(x) => Man(x)`:\nANSWER: True\n\nIf we are forced to be strictly formal and not infer anything not explicitly stated, then `Man(Harry)` is not given.\nLet's consider the possibility of a \"gentleman\" who is not a \"man.\" This would make the problem \"Uncertain.\"\n\nGiven typical FOL problems, the intent is usually to use common-sense implications. \"Gentleman\" is a type of \"man.\"\n\nLet's stick to the most direct interpretation:\n1.  `Gentleman(Harry)` (Premise 6)\n2.  `Handsome(Harry)` (From 1 and Premise 4)\n3.  `NOT Ugly(Harry)` (From 2 and Premise 2: `Ugly(x) => NOT Handsome(x)` implies `Handsome(x) => NOT Ugly(x)`)\n4.  `NOT Evil(Harry)` (From 3 and Premise 3: `Evil(x) => Ugly(x)` implies `NOT Ugly(x) => NOT Evil(x)`)\n\nAt this point, we know `NOT Evil(Harry)`.\nThe conclusion is `Kind(Harry) OR CEO(Harry)`.\n\nWe don't know `Kind(Harry)` unless we know `Man(Harry)` to apply Premise 1.\nWe don't know `CEO(Harry)`. We only know `Gentleman(Harry)`, and `CEO(x) => Gentleman(x)` (Premise 5) doesn't work in reverse.\n\nSo, if we are strictly formal, `Man(Harry)` is not given. Therefore, we cannot apply `Man(x) => Kind(x) OR Evil(x)`.\nThus, `Kind(Harry)` remains unknown.\n`CEO(Harry)` also remains unknown.\nTherefore, `Kind(Harry) OR CEO(Harry)` is uncertain.\n\nThe previous example's reasoning for \"Uncertain\" (\"we know nothing about whether it is dispensable\") supports a strict interpretation where unstated common-sense inferences are not made.\n\nLet's follow the strict interpretation.\n\nWe can derive `NOT Evil(Harry)`.\nThe conclusion is `Kind(Harry) OR CEO(Harry)`.\nWe have no premise that links `Gentleman(Harry)` to `Kind(Harry)` or `CEO(Harry)` in a way that makes the conclusion true.\nSpecifically:\n- We don't know `Man(Harry)`, so Premise 1 `Man(x) => Kind(x) OR Evil(x)` doesn't necessarily apply to Harry.\n- We don't know `CEO(Harry)`.\n\nTherefore, we cannot confirm `Kind(Harry)` and we cannot confirm `CEO(Harry)`.

This means if Luke is T, then H is true.\n\nLet's consider Case 1 for Luke: T & D.\nIf Luke is T, then by Premise 1 (T -> H), Luke spends a lot of time hanging out and playing with his siblings (H).\nAlso, if Luke is D (develops strong bonds), then from Premise 4 (~L -> ~D), we can infer by contrapositive that D -> L (If Luke develops strong bonds, then Luke lives at home regularly). So, if Luke is D, then Luke is L.\nHowever, from Premise 5 (H -> ~L), if Luke is H, then Luke does not live at home regularly (~L).\nThis creates a potential contradiction: if Luke is T, then H is true. If H is true, then ~L is true. But if Luke is D, then L is true. So, if Luke is T and D, then H is true, and ~L is true, and L is true, which is a contradiction.\nThis means Case 1 (T & D) leads to a contradiction with the other premises.\nLet's re-examine:\nAssume T & D.\nFrom T and P1: H.\nFrom D and P4 (contrapositive: D -> L): L.\nFrom H and P5: ~L.\nSo, if T & D, then H and L and ~L, which is impossible.\nTherefore, Case 1 (T & D) is impossible given the other premises.\n\nSince Case 1 is impossible, Luke must be in Case 2: ~T & ~D.\nIf Luke is ~T, then from Premise 1 (T -> H), we cannot infer anything about H. H could be true or false.\nIf Luke is ~D, then from Premise 4 (~L -> ~D), we cannot infer anything about L. ~L could be true or false.\n\nLet's see if H *must* be true given ~T & ~D.\nIf Luke is ~T, then Premise 1 (T -> H) does not force H to be true. H could be false.\nFor example, if T is false, then T -> H is true regardless of H.\nSo, if Luke is ~T, Luke is not a twin or triplet. This means Premise 1 does not guarantee H.\n\nLet's try to construct a scenario where the premises hold, Luke is ~T & ~D, and H is false.\n- Luke is ~T (not a twin/triplet)\n- Luke is ~D (does not develop strong bonds)\n- We want H to be false.\n\nIf H is false, then Premise 1 (T -> H) implies that T must be false, which aligns with ~T.\nIf H is false, then Premise 5 (H -> ~L) is true regardless of ~L.\n\nSo, if Luke is ~T and ~D and ~H:\n- P1: T -> H (False -> False) is True.\n- P2: S -> T (Can be anything, e.g., S is false)\n- P3: C -> S (Can be anything, e.g., C is false)\n- P4: ~L -> ~D (If ~D is true, then ~L could be true or false. If we make ~L false, i.e., L is true, then ~L -> ~D is False -> True, which is true. So Luke lives at home (L) and doesn't develop strong bonds (~D). This is consistent).\n- P5: H -> ~L (False -> ~L) is True.\n- P6: (~T & ~D) is true. This is what we assumed.\n\nSo, it is possible for Luke to be ~T, ~D, and ~H (not spend a lot of time hanging out and playing with his siblings).\nSince we found that Case 1 (T & D) leads to a contradiction, Luke must be ~T & ~D.\nAnd if Luke is ~T & ~D, it does not necessarily mean H is true.

It states that for Luke:\n(T ^ D) v (~T ^ ~D)\nThis is a biconditional: T <-> D. Luke is a twin/triplet if and only if he develops strong bonds with his family members.\n\nNow let's chain the implications:\nFrom (3) C -> A\nFrom (2) A -> T\nFrom (1) T -> S\nFrom (5) S -> ~L\nFrom (4) ~L -> ~D\n\nCombining these, we get:\nC -> A -> T -> S -> ~L -> ~D\nTherefore, C -> ~D (If Luke complains often about annoying siblings, then he does not develop strong bonds with his family members).\n\nWe also know from Premise 6 that T <-> D.\nThis means:\nIf T, then D.\nIf ~T, then ~D.\n\nConsider the conclusion: ~(T v Triplet) ^ ~C.\nThis means Luke is NOT a twin/triplet AND Luke does NOT complain often.\n\nLet's use the derived C -> ~D.\nIf C is True, then ~D is True.\nIf ~D is True, then from T <-> D, it must be that ~T is True.\nSo, if C, then ~T.\n\nThis means if Luke complains (C), then he is not a twin/triplet (~T).\n\nWhat if Luke does *not* complain (~C)?\nIf ~C, then the implication C -> ~D doesn't tell us anything about ~D.\nAnd if ~T, then from T <-> D, we know ~D.\n\nLet's try to prove the conclusion: ~(T v Triplet) ^ ~C.\n\nAssume the conclusion is False. This means:\n(T v Triplet) v C\n\nCase 1: Luke is a twin/triplet (T).\nIf T, then from T <-> D, we know D (Luke develops strong bonds).\nAlso, from T -> S (Premise 1), Luke spends a lot of time with siblings.\nFrom S -> ~L (Premise 5), Luke does not live at home regularly.\nFrom ~L -> ~D (Premise 4), Luke does not develop strong bonds.\nSo, if T, then D AND ~D, which is a contradiction.\nTherefore, Luke cannot be a twin/triplet (T). So, ~T must be true.\n\nSince T leads to a contradiction, T must be False.\nSo, Luke is NOT a twin/triplet (~T).\n\nNow that we know ~T, from T <-> D (Premise 6), we must have ~D. (Luke does not develop strong bonds).\n\nNow consider the second part of the conclusion: ~C (Luke does not complain often).\nWe know C -> ~D (derived earlier).\nSince we've established ~D (Luke does not develop strong bonds), this implication C -> ~D is consistent. It does not force ~C.\nIf C is true, then ~D is true, which is consistent with what we derived (~T -> ~D).\n\nLet's re-examine the derivation:\n1. C -> A (Premise 3)\n2. A -> T (Premise 2)\n3. T -> S (Premise 1)\n4. S -> ~L (Premise 5)\n5. ~L -> ~D (Premise 4)\nChain: C -> A -> T -> S -> ~L -> ~D. So, C -> ~D.\n\nFrom Premise 6: (T ^ D) v (~T ^ ~D). This means T <-> D.\n\nLet's try to prove ~T.\nAssume T.\nIf T, then by T <-> D, we have D.\nIf T, then by Premise 1, S.\nIf S, then by Premise 5, ~L.\nIf ~L, then by Premise 4, ~D.\nSo, if T, then D and ~D. This is a contradiction.\nTherefore, T must be False. So, ~T is True.\n\nSince ~T is True, and T <-> D, it must be that ~D is True. (Luke does not develop strong bonds).\n\nNow we have established ~T.\nThe conclusion is ~T ^ ~C.

Let `TidyAndEnjoy(x)` represent `Tidy(x) AND EnjoyCleaning(x)`.\n\nFrom premise 6, we have two cases for Peter:\n\n**Case 1: `SpillFood(Peter) AND OnlyChild(Peter)`**\n\n*   If `SpillFood(Peter)` is true, then from premise 1, `NOT TidyAndEnjoy(Peter)` is true.\n*   If `OnlyChild(Peter)` is true, then from premise 3, `TidyAndEnjoy(Peter)` is true.\n\nThis case leads to a contradiction: `NOT TidyAndEnjoy(Peter)` AND `TidyAndEnjoy(Peter)`. This means Case 1 is impossible.\n\n**Case 2: `NOT SpillFood(Peter) AND NOT OnlyChild(Peter)`**\n\n*   If `NOT SpillFood(Peter)` is true, premise 1 (`SpillFood(x) -> NOT TidyAndEnjoy(x)`) tells us nothing about `TidyAndEnjoy(Peter)`. The antecedent is false, so the implication is true regardless of the consequent.\n*   If `NOT OnlyChild(Peter)` is true, premise 3 (`OnlyChild(x) -> TidyAndEnjoy(x)`) tells us nothing about `TidyAndEnjoy(Peter)`. The antecedent is false, so the implication is true regardless of the consequent.\n\nIn Case 2, we know that Peter does NOT spill a lot of food and is NOT an only child. However, these facts alone do not directly imply whether Peter tidies his space consistently and enjoys the process of cleaning. The premises about parents being busy and high net income households are not directly applicable to Peter's situation unless we know more about him (e.g., if he's in a high net income household).\n\nSince Case 1 leads to a contradiction, it must be that Case 2 is true for Peter: `NOT SpillFood(Peter) AND NOT OnlyChild(Peter)`.\n\nHowever, knowing `NOT SpillFood(Peter)` and `NOT OnlyChild(Peter)` is not sufficient to conclude `Tidy(Peter) AND EnjoyCleaning(Peter)`. The implications `SpillFood(x) -> NOT TidyAndEnjoy(x)` and `OnlyChild(x) -> TidyAndEnjoy(x)` are one-way. We don't have information like `NOT SpillFood(x) -> TidyAndEnjoy(x)` or `NOT OnlyChild(x) -> NOT TidyAndEnjoy(x)`.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we cannot definitively conclude that Peter tidies his space consistently and enjoys the process of cleaning.\n\nThe other premises (2, 4, 5) provide chains of implications but do not help resolve the conclusion for Peter, as we don't have information about Peter being a foodie or his parents being busy or his household's income.\n\n**Final check:**\nThe crucial part is premise 6.\nLet P = SpillFood(Peter)\nLet O = OnlyChild(Peter)\nPremise 6 is (P AND O) OR (NOT P AND NOT O).\n\nFrom premise 1: P -> NOT (Tidy AND Enjoy)\nFrom premise 3: O -> (Tidy AND Enjoy)\n\nIf (P AND O) were true:\nThen P is true, so NOT (Tidy AND Enjoy) is true.\nAnd O is true, so (Tidy AND Enjoy) is true.\nThis is a contradiction. Therefore, (P AND O) must be false.\n\nSince (P AND O) OR (NOT P AND NOT O) is true, and (P AND O) is false, it must be that (NOT P AND NOT O) is true.\nSo, Peter does NOT SpillFood and Peter is NOT an OnlyChild.\n\nNow, does (NOT P AND NOT O) imply (Tidy AND Enjoy)?\nFrom P -> NOT (Tidy AND Enjoy), if P is false, the implication is true regardless of (Tidy AND Enjoy).\nFrom O -> (Tidy AND Enjoy), if O is false, the implication is true regardless of (Tidy AND Enjoy).\n\nWe have no other premises that link `NOT SpillFood` or `NOT OnlyChild` directly to `Tidy AND Enjoy`.

From Premise 6 (`NOT CanBlockShooting(Michael, Windy)`) and Premise 5 (`CanBlockShooting(Michael, x) <= NOT JumpsWhenShooting(x)`), we can infer that Windy *must* be able to jump when shooting. If Windy *couldn't* jump, Michael *would* be able to block her shooting according to Premise 5, which contradicts Premise 6.\n    *   Therefore, `JumpsWhenShooting(Windy)` is true.\n\n2.  From Premise 4 (`Taller(Peter, Michael)`) and Premise 2 (Michael is taller than everyone else in his class), we know Peter is taller than Michael. This also implies Peter is a man (Premise 4) and Michael is a man (Premise 2).\n\n3.  Now, let's consider Peter blocking Windy's shooting. For Peter to block Windy's shooting, according to Premise 1, Peter must be a man, Windy must be a man, and Peter must be taller than Windy.\n    *   We know `Man(Peter)` (from Premise 4).\n    *   We don't know if `Man(Windy)`. The premises only state `JumpsWhenShooting(Windy)`.\n\n4.  Even if we assume Windy is a man (which is not explicitly stated but often implicitly assumed in such problems if not specified otherwise for basketball-like scenarios), we need to determine if `Taller(Peter, Windy)`.\n    *   We know `Taller(Peter, Michael)` (Premise 4).\n    *   We know `Taller(Michael, x)` for everyone *else* in his class (Premise 2). We don't know if Windy is in Michael's class.\n    *   If Windy is in Michael's class, then `Taller(Michael, Windy)`. Combined with `Taller(Peter, Michael)` and the transitivity rule (Premise 3), this would mean `Taller(Peter, Windy)`. In this specific case, if Windy is a man, then Peter *could* block Windy's shooting.\n    *   However, if Windy is *not* in Michael's class, we have no information about Michael's height relative to Windy's, nor Peter's height relative to Windy's, other than that Peter is taller than Michael.\n\n5.  The critical point is that the ability to block shooting (Premise 1) is simply `Taller(x, y) AND Man(x) AND Man(y) => CanBlockShooting(x, y)`. There are no conditions about jumping for the general blocking rule. The jumping condition *only* applies to Michael's specific blocking ability (Premise 5).\n\n6.  We have `Taller(Peter, Michael)` and `Man(Peter)` and `Man(Michael)`.\n    We need `Taller(Peter, Windy)` and `Man(Windy)`.\n\n    *   We don't know if Windy is a man.\n    *   We don't know if Peter is taller than Windy. We only know Peter is taller than Michael. Michael is taller than everyone *in his class*. We don't know if Windy is in Michael's class.\n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively conclude that Peter can block Windy's shooting. The premises do not provide enough information about Windy's gender or her height relative to Peter.\n\nANSWER: Uncertain"], "answers": ["Uncertain"], "reference": "Uncertain", "time_total": 7.16059684753418, "time_llm": 7.16019606590271, "prompt_length": 1860}

(Transitivity of location)\n\nConclusion: Barutin is not located in Antarctica.\n\nLet's use the transitivity premise to determine the location of Barutin Cove:\nFrom Premise 2: Barutin Cove is located in Snow Island.\nFrom Premise 3: Snow Island is located in The South Shetland Islands.\nApplying Premise 5 (A=Barutin Cove, B=Snow Island, C=The South Shetland Islands): Barutin Cove is located in The South Shetland Islands.\n\nFrom the previous step: Barutin Cove is located in The South Shetland Islands.\nFrom Premise 4: The South Shetland Islands are located in Antarctica.\nApplying Premise 5 (A=Barutin Cove, B=The South Shetland Islands, C=Antarctica): Barutin Cove is located in Antarctica.\n\nSo, we know that Barutin Cove is in Antarctica.\n\nNow, let's consider the settlement of Barutin.\nPremise 1 states: \"Barutin Cove is named after the Bulgarian settlement of Barutin.\"\nThis premise only establishes a naming relationship. It *does not* state that Barutin (the settlement) is located in the same place as Barutin Cove. In fact, it implies that Barutin (the settlement) is Bulgarian, which suggests it's in Bulgaria, a country in Europe, not Antarctica.\n\nThe premises give us no direct information about the location of the *settlement* Barutin, other than its implied origin (Bulgarian). They tell us where Barutin Cove is, but not where the settlement Barutin is. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that the settlement Barutin is *not* in Antarctica based *only* on the provided premises. It's highly probable it's not, given it's a \"Bulgarian settlement,\" but the premises don't *explicitly* state its location or a rule that a settlement naming a cove must be in a different location. The conclusion states it is *not* in Antarctica.\n\nHowever, the premise \"Barutin Cove is named after the Bulgarian settlement of Barutin\" strongly implies the settlement Barutin is in Bulgaria. If Barutin is a Bulgarian settlement, it is by definition in Bulgaria. Bulgaria is in Europe, not Antarctica. Therefore, Barutin (the settlement) is not in Antarctica.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the implication. \"Bulgarian settlement\" means a settlement in Bulgaria. Bulgaria is not in Antarctica. So, the settlement Barutin is not in Antarctica.\nThe conclusion states \"Barutin is not located in Antarctica.\" This aligns with the logical deduction from \"Bulgarian settlement\".\n\nTherefore, the conclusion *does* follow from the premises.\n\nStep 1: Identify what is known about Barutin (the settlement).\nPremise 1: \"Barutin Cove is named after the Bulgarian settlement of Barutin.\"\nThe term \"Bulgarian settlement\" implies that Barutin (the settlement) is located in Bulgaria.\n\nStep 2: Determine the location of Bulgaria relative to Antarctica.\nBulgaria is a country in Europe. Europe is a continent distinct from Antarctica.\nTherefore, Bulgaria is not located in Antarctica.\n\nStep 3: Conclude about Barutin's location.\nSince Barutin (the settlement) is in Bulgaria, and Bulgaria is not in Antarctica, it follows that Barutin (the settlement) is not located in Antarctica.\n\nStep 4: Compare with the conclusion.\nThe conclusion states \"Barutin is not located in Antarctica.\" This is consistent with our deduction.\n\nThe premise \"Barutin Cove is named after the Bulgarian settlement of Barutin\" is key.

It's a conditional statement about the existence of Greyhound planes.)\n\n2.  **Combine relevant premises to deduce information about planes and airlines:**\n    *   From P4 (`boeing_707(X) -> plane(X)`) and P3 (`plane(X) -> empty(X)`), we can infer: `boeing_707(X) -> empty(X)`.\n    *   From P2 (`airline(X) -> can_transport_multiple_passengers(X)`) and P1 (`can_transport_multiple_passengers(X) -> NOT empty(X)`), we can infer: `airline(X) -> NOT empty(X)`.\n\n3.  **Consider the implications for Greyhound:**\n    *   We want to know if `boeing_707(Greyhound)` is true.\n    *   If `boeing_707(Greyhound)` were true, then from our deduction `boeing_707(X) -> empty(X)`, it would imply `empty(Greyhound)`.\n    *   Now consider P5: `NOT airline(Greyhound) -> NOT exists X (plane(X) AND is_of_type(X, Greyhound))`. This premise tells us something about Greyhound *if* it's not an airline. It doesn't directly tell us if Greyhound *is* an airline or *is* a Boeing 707.\n\n4.  **Look for direct connections to \"Greyhound is a Boeing 707\":**\n    *   None of the premises state directly that Greyhound is a Boeing 707.\n    *   None of the premises state directly that Greyhound is a plane.\n    *   None of the premises state directly that Greyhound is an airline.\n\n5.  **Can we derive a contradiction or a necessary truth?**\n    *   Suppose Greyhound *is* a Boeing 707. Then Greyhound is a plane (P4) and Greyhound is empty (P3).\n    *   Suppose Greyhound *is* an airline. Then Greyhound `can_transport_multiple_passengers` (P2) and Greyhound is `NOT empty` (P1). This contradicts `empty(Greyhound)` which we derived if it's a Boeing 707.\n    *   This means `IF (boeing_707(Greyhound) AND airline(Greyhound)) THEN (empty(Greyhound) AND NOT empty(Greyhound))`, which is a contradiction.\n    *   Therefore, Greyhound cannot be *both* a Boeing 707 *and* an airline.\n\n    *   However, the conclusion simply states \"A Greyhound is a Boeing 707.\" We have no information to confirm or deny this.\n    *   The premises tell us about properties of things that are airlines, planes, or Boeing 707s. They don't identify Greyhound as belonging to any of these categories, nor do they exclude it. P5 only provides a conditional statement about Greyhound's status as an airline and the existence of Greyhound planes, which doesn't directly confirm or deny Greyhound itself being a Boeing 707.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** We cannot logically deduce from the given premises whether \"A Greyhound is a Boeing 707\" is true or false. There's no information linking \"Greyhound\" specifically to \"Boeing 707\" or any of the other defined categories in a way that would force this conclusion or its negation.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{Uncertain}$"], "answers": ["Uncertain"], "reference": "False", "time_total": 5.938151121139526, "time_llm": 5.937669515609741, "prompt_length": 1608}

If Rock is a bird, then `NOT Bird(Rock)` is false, so the antecedent is false, and the implication holds true.\n- If Rock is a bird, then Rock is not a monkey.\n\nSince there exists a scenario (Rock being a bird) where all premises are true but the conclusion \"Rock is a monkey\" is false, the conclusion does not follow from the premises.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is uncertain.\n\nANSWER: Uncertain"], "answers": ["Uncertain"], "reference": "Uncertain", "time_total": 10.927190065383911, "time_llm": 10.926695585250854, "prompt_length": 1600}

So `NOT(Monkey(Rock))` and `NOT(Bird(Rock))`.\n\nIf `NOT(Bird(Rock))`, then (from 7) `(NOT(Flies(Rock)) AND NOT(Bird(Rock))) -> (NOT(Flies(Rock)) AND NOT(Breathes(Rock)))`.\nThis premise 7 is about a conditional statement. It doesn't force Rock to be a certain way, it just states a relationship.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the argument that if Rock is a Monkey, it must fly. This seems sound.\nThis means:\n1. If Rock is a Bird, then Rock flies (4) -> Rock has wings (6).\n2. If Rock is a Monkey, then Rock flies (deduced from 1,2,3,5,7) -> Rock has wings (6).\n\nFrom (3), `An animal is either a monkey or a bird`.\nSo, if Rock is an Animal, then Rock is either a Monkey or a Bird.\nIn both sub-cases (Monkey or Bird), we've shown that Rock has wings.\nTherefore, if Rock is an Animal, then Rock has wings.\n\nWhat if Rock is NOT an animal?\nIf `NOT(Animal(Rock))`:\n*   From (5) `Animal(x) -> Breathes(x)`, so `NOT(Breathes(Rock))`.\n*   From (1) `Mammal(x) -> Animal(x)`, so `NOT(Mammal(Rock))`.\n*   From (2) `Monkey(x) -> Mammal(x)`, so `NOT(Monkey(Rock))`.\n*   From (3) `Animal(x) -> (Monkey(x) XOR Bird(x))`. Since `NOT(Animal(Rock))`, this premise tells us nothing directly about whether Rock is a Bird. It simply means Rock cannot be a Monkey *or* a Bird *because it's an animal*. If it's not an animal, it's not a Monkey and not a Bird. So `NOT(Bird(Rock))`.\n\nSo, if `NOT(Animal(Rock))`, then:\n*   `NOT(Breathes(Rock))`\n*   `NOT(Bird(Rock))`\n*   `NOT(Monkey(Rock))`\n\nNow consider premise 7: `If Rock is neither a fly nor a bird, then Rock neither flies nor breathes.`\n` (NOT(Flies(Rock)) AND NOT(Bird(Rock))) -> (NOT(Flies(Rock)) AND NOT(Breathes(Rock)))`\n\nWe know `NOT(Bird(Rock))` is true if Rock is not an animal.\nSo, the antecedent becomes `(NOT(Flies(Rock)) AND TRUE) -> (NOT(Flies(Rock)) AND NOT(Breathes(Rock)))`\nWhich simplifies to `NOT(Flies(Rock)) -> (NOT(Flies(Rock)) AND NOT(Breathes(Rock)))`\n\nWe also know `NOT(Breathes(Rock))` is true if Rock is not an animal.\nSo, the consequent becomes `(NOT(Flies(Rock)) AND TRUE)`.\nSo, if Rock is not an animal, premise 7 simplifies to:\n`NOT(Flies(Rock)) -> NOT(Flies(Rock))`\nThis statement is a tautology (it's always true). It doesn't help us determine if `Flies(Rock)` or `HasWings(Rock)` is true or false if Rock is not an animal.\n\nIf Rock is not an animal, Rock is not a bird, not a monkey, and does not breathe. We have no information about whether it flies or has wings.\nFor example, Rock could be a stone. A stone is not an animal, does not breathe, is not a bird. Does it fly? Does it have wings? We cannot say.\n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively conclude that \"Rock has wings\". It depends on whether Rock is an animal or not. If Rock is an animal, it has wings. If Rock is not an animal, the premises do not provide enough information to determine if it has wings.\n\nThus, the conclusion is uncertain.\n\nFinal check of the \"Monkey must fly\" deduction:\n1. Assume `Monkey(Rock)`.\n2. From (2) `Monkey(Rock) -> Mammal(Rock)`.\n3. From (1) `Mammal(Rock) -> Animal(Rock)`. So `Animal(Rock)`.\n4. From (5) `Animal(Rock) -> Breathes(Rock)`. So `Breathes(Rock)`.\n5. From (3) `Animal(Rock) -> (Monkey(Rock) XOR Bird(Rock))`. Since `Monkey(Rock)` and `Animal(Rock)`, then `NOT(Bird(Rock))`.\n6. Now, consider the contrapositive of (7): `(Flies(Rock) OR Breathes(Rock)) -> (Flies(Rock) OR Bird(Rock))`.\n7. We know `Breathes(Rock)` (from 4). So `(Flies(Rock) OR Breathes(Rock))` is true.\n8. Therefore, `(Flies(Rock) OR Bird(Rock))` must be true.\n9. We know `NOT(Bird(Rock))` (from 5).\n10. For `(Flies(Rock) OR Bird(Rock))` to be true, and `NOT(Bird(Rock))` is true, then `Flies(Rock)` must be true.\nThis deduction is solid. If Rock is a Monkey, it must fly.\n\nSo, if Rock is an Animal, it has wings.\nThe problem is we don't know if Rock is an Animal.\n\nIf Rock is not an animal, then:\n- Rock does not breathe (from 5).\n- Rock is not a bird (from 3, since it's not an animal).\n- Premise 7 states: `If (NOT Flies(Rock) AND NOT Bird(Rock)) then (NOT Flies(Rock) AND NOT Breathes(Rock))`.\n- Since Rock is not an animal, `NOT Bird(Rock)` is true and `NOT Breathes(Rock)` is true.\n- So, premise 7 becomes: `If (NOT Flies(Rock) AND TRUE) then (NOT Flies(Rock) AND TRUE)`.\n- Which simplifies to: `If NOT Flies(Rock) then NOT Flies(Rock)`. This is a tautology and provides no information about whether Rock flies or not, or has wings or not.\n\nConsider a scenario where Rock is not an animal:\nScenario A: Rock is a rock (inanimate object).\n- Not an animal, not a mammal, not a monkey, not a bird.\n- Doesn't breathe.\n- Does not fly.\n- Does not have wings.\nIn this scenario, `Rock has wings` is False.\n\nScenario B: Rock is a flying toy plane.\n- Not an animal, not a mammal, not a monkey, not a bird.\n- Doesn't breathe.\n- Flies.\n- Has wings.\nIn this scenario, `Rock has wings` is True.\n\nSince both scenarios are consistent with the premises but lead to different conclusions about `Rock has wings`, the conclusion is Uncertain.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{Uncertain}$"], "answers": ["Uncertain"], "reference": "True", "time_total": 19.237507343292236, "time_llm": 19.23666214942932, "prompt_length": 1598}

In this case, `~HasWings(Rock)` is false.\n\nSince Rock *must* be either a Monkey or a Bird if it's an Animal (Premise 3), and in both cases `HasWings(Rock)` is true, the conclusion `~HasWings(Rock)` is false if Rock is an animal.\n\nWhat if Rock is *not* an animal?\nIf `~Animal(Rock)`, then from (3), `~Monkey(Rock)` AND `~Bird(Rock)`.\nSince `~Bird(Rock)` is true, premise 7 `(~Flies(Rock) ^ ~Bird(Rock)) -> (~Flies(Rock) ^ ~Breathes(Rock))` simplifies to `~Flies(Rock) -> (~Flies(Rock) ^ ~Breathes(Rock))`.\nThis further implies `~Flies(Rock) -> ~Breathes(Rock)`.\n\nIf `~Animal(Rock)`, then premise 5 `Animal(x) -> Breathes(x)` doesn't tell us anything about `Breathes(Rock)`.\nIn this case, if Rock does not fly (`~Flies(Rock)`), then it does not breathe (`~Breathes(Rock)`).\nAnd if `~Flies(Rock)`, then `~HasWings(Rock)` (from premise 6).\nSo, if Rock is not an animal and does not fly, it does not have wings. This scenario is consistent with the conclusion.\n\nHowever, the premises do not force Rock to be `~Flies(Rock)`. Rock could be something that is not an animal but still flies (e.g., an airplane, a fly).\nIf Rock is `Flies(Rock)`, then `HasWings(Rock)` (from premise 6).

Let's call this person 'Someone'.\nSo, `WIJ(Someone) \u2227 WW(Someone)`.\n\nNow, let's consider John.\n\nLook at premise (5): `HAC(John) \u2192 (\u00acTTPH(John) \u2227 \u00acHWC(John))`\nThis premise is very strong. It states that if John has at least one child, then he *cannot* travel to Paris for his honeymoon *and* he *cannot* have a wedding.\n\nLet's assume for the sake of contradiction that `HAC(John)` is true.\nIf `HAC(John)` is true, then by (5), `\u00acTTPH(John)` and `\u00acHWC(John)`.\n\nNow consider premise (6): `(HWC(John) \u2227 WW(John)) \u2192 (WIJ(John) \u2228 TTPH(John))`\nThis premise describes what happens if John has a well-attended wedding.\n\nLet's look at the implications of the chain `WIJ(x) \u2192 TTPH(x) \u2192 HWC(x) \u2192 HAC(x)`.\n\nIf John's wedding were in July (`WIJ(John)`), then by the chain, `HAC(John)` would be true.\nBut if `HAC(John)` is true, then by (5), `\u00acHWC(John)` and `\u00acTTPH(John)`.\nThis creates a contradiction:\nIf `WIJ(John)`, then `TTPH(John)` (by 3) and `HWC(John)` (by 2).\nBut if `HAC(John)` (which would be implied by `WIJ(John)`), then `\u00acTTPH(John)` and `\u00acHWC(John)`.\nSo, `WIJ(John)` leads to a contradiction. Therefore, `\u00acWIJ(John)` must be true. John's wedding is not in July.\n\nSince `WIJ(John)` is false, John cannot be the 'Someone' from premise (4) whose wedding is in July and well-attended. Premise (4) only guarantees *existence* of such a person, not that John is that person.\n\nLet's re-examine (5): `HAC(John) \u2192 (\u00acTTPH(John) \u2227 \u00acHWC(John))`\nThe contrapositive of (5) is `(TTPH(John) \u2228 HWC(John)) \u2192 \u00acHAC(John)`.\nThis means if John travels to Paris for his honeymoon OR John has a wedding, then John does NOT have at least one child.\n\nNow, let's use the chain from premises (1), (2), (3):\n`WIJ(x) \u2192 TTPH(x) \u2192 HWC(x) \u2192 HAC(x)`\n\nIf John has a wedding (`HWC(John)`), then by the contrapositive of (5), `\u00acHAC(John)`.\nBut by (1), `HWC(John) \u2192 HAC(John)`.\nThis is a direct contradiction: `HWC(John)` implies `HAC(John)` by (1), but `HWC(John)` implies `\u00acHAC(John)` by the contrapositive of (5).\nTherefore, `HWC(John)` must be false. John does not have a wedding.\n\nIf John does not have a wedding (`\u00acHWC(John)`), then the antecedent of premise (6) `(HWC(John) \u2227 WW(John))` is false, making premise (6) vacuously true and providing no information about John's situation.\n\nSince `\u00acHWC(John)` is true, John cannot have a wedding.\nIf John cannot have a wedding, then he also cannot travel to Paris for his honeymoon (because `TTPH(John) \u2192 HWC(John)` implies `\u00acHWC(John) \u2192 \u00acTTPH(John)`). So, `\u00acTTPH(John)` is also true.\nAnd he cannot have a wedding in July (`WIJ(John) \u2192 TTPH(John)` implies `\u00acTTPH(John) \u2192 \u00acWIJ(John)`). So, `\u00acWIJ(John)` is also true.\n\nSo, we have established:\n*   `\u00acHWC(John)` (John does not have a wedding)\n*   `\u00acTTPH(John)` (John does not travel to Paris for his honeymoon)\n*   `\u00acWIJ(John)` (John's wedding is not in July)\n\nNow, let's revisit premise (5): `HAC(John) \u2192 (\u00acTTPH(John) \u2227 \u00acHWC(John))`\nSince we have derived `\u00acTTPH(John)` and `\u00acHWC(John)`, the consequent `(\u00acTTPH(John) \u2227 \u00acHWC(John))` is true.\nThis means that the implication `HAC(John) \u2192 TRUE` is true.\nHowever, this does *not* mean `HAC(John)` is true. An implication `P \u2192 Q` is true if `Q` is true, regardless of `P`. So `HAC(John)` could be true or false.\n\nLet's review.\nWe deduced `\u00acHWC(John)`.\nFrom (1), `HWC(John) \u2192 HAC(John)`. Since `\u00acHWC(John)`, we cannot use modus ponens to conclude `HAC(John)`. We also cannot use modus tollens to conclude `\u00acHAC(John)`.\n\nThe crucial part is the contradiction derived earlier:\nAssume `HWC(John)`.\nFrom (1), `HWC(John) \u2192 HAC(John)`. So, `HAC(John)`.\nFrom (5), `HAC(John) \u2192 (\u00acTTPH(John) \u2227 \u00acHWC(John))`. So, `\u00acHWC(John)`.\nThis means `HWC(John)` leads to `\u00acHWC(John)`, which is a contradiction.\nTherefore, the assumption `HWC(John)` must be false.\nSo, `\u00acHWC(John)` is definitively true. John does not have a wedding.\n\nIf John does not have a wedding, then:\n*   He does not travel to Paris for his honeymoon (from premise 2: `TTPH(x) \u2192 HWC(x)`, so `\u00acHWC(x) \u2192 \u00acTTPH(x)`).\n*   He does not have a wedding in July (from premise 3: `WIJ(x) \u2192 TTPH(x)`, so `\u00acTTPH(x) \u2192 \u00acWIJ(x)`).\n\nSo, we know `\u00acHWC(John)`, `\u00acTTPH(John)`, and `\u00acWIJ(John)`.\n\nNow, consider the conclusion `HAC(John)`.\n\nFrom premise (5): `HAC(John) \u2192 (\u00acTTPH(John) \u2227 \u00acHWC(John))`\nWe know `(\u00acTTPH(John) \u2227 \u00acHWC(John))` is true. This makes premise (5) true regardless of `HAC(John)`. So it doesn't force `HAC(John)` to be true or false.\n\nFrom premise (1): `HWC(John) \u2192 HAC(John)`\nSince `\u00acHWC(John)`, this premise gives us no information about `HAC(John)` (the antecedent is false, so the implication is true regardless of the consequent).\n\nThe information that John does not have a wedding, does not travel to Paris for his honeymoon, and does not have a wedding in July, is derived. This information is consistent with John having at least one child OR not having at least one child, according to premise (5).\n\nFor example, if `HAC(John)` is true, then `\u00acTTPH(John) \u2227 \u00acHWC(John)` holds. This is consistent with what we derived.\nIf `HAC(John)` is false, then premise (5) `FALSE \u2192 (\u00acTTPH(John) \u2227 \u00acHWC(John))` is still true, which is also consistent.\n\nPremise (4) `\u2203x (WIJ(x) \u2227 WW(x))` only tells us that *someone* exists who has a well-attended wedding in July. It doesn't imply anything specific about John, especially since we've deduced `\u00acWIJ(John)`.\n\nTherefore, based on the premises, we cannot definitively conclude whether John has at least one child.\n\nLet's re-verify the deduction `\u00acHWC(John)`.\n1. Assume `HWC(John)`.\n2. From (1), `HWC(John) \u2192 HAC(John)`. So, `HAC(John)`.\n3. From (5), `HAC(John) \u2192 (\u00acTTPH(John) \u2227 \u00acHWC(John))`.\n4. Since `HAC(John)` (from step 2) is the antecedent of (5), we can infer `(\u00acTTPH(John) \u2227 \u00acHWC(John))`.\n5. This implies `\u00acHWC(John)`.\n6. But our initial assumption was `HWC(John)`.\n7. `HWC(John)` and `\u00acHWC(John)` is a contradiction.\n8. Therefore, the assumption `HWC(John)` must be false. So, `\u00acHWC(John)`. This deduction is solid.\n\nSince `\u00acHWC(John)`, the antecedent of premise (6) `(HWC(John) \u2227 WW(John))` is false, so premise (6) provides no information.\n\nThe conclusion `HAC(John)` is not forced by the premises. The premises are consistent with both `HAC(John)` and `\u00acHAC(John)`.\n\nExample:\nScenario 1: `HAC(John)` is true.\nThen by (5), `\u00acTTPH(John)` and `\u00acHWC(John)`. This is consistent with our deductions.\nPremise (1) `HWC(John) \u2192 HAC(John)` becomes `FALSE \u2192 TRUE`, which is true.\nPremise (2) `TTPH(John) \u2192 HWC(John)` becomes `FALSE \u2192 FALSE`, which is true.\nPremise (3) `WIJ(John) \u2192 TTPH(John)` becomes `FALSE \u2192 FALSE`, which is true.\nPremise (6) `(HWC(John) \u2227 WW(John)) \u2192 (WIJ(John) \u2228 TTPH(John))` becomes `(FALSE \u2227 WW(John)) \u2192 (FALSE \u2228 FALSE)`, which is `FALSE \u2192 FALSE`, true.\nAll premises hold.\n\nScenario 2: `HAC(John)` is false (`\u00acHAC(John)` is true).\nThen by (5), the antecedent `HAC(John)` is false, so the implication is true regardless of the consequent.\nBy the contrapositive of (5): `(TTPH(John) \u2228 HWC(John)) \u2192 \u00acHAC(John)`. Since `\u00acHAC(John)` is true, this implication is true regardless of the antecedent.\nHowever, we still know `\u00acHWC(John)` (derived from the contradiction).\nIf `\u00acHAC(John)` is true, and `\u00acHWC(John)` is true, and `\u00acTTPH(John)` is true, all premises hold.\nPremise (1) `HWC(John) \u2192 HAC(John)` becomes `FALSE \u2192 FALSE`, which is true.\nAll other premises are evaluated as in Scenario 1 based on `\u00acHWC(John)` etc.\n\nSince both `HAC(John)` and `\u00acHAC(John)` are consistent with the premises, the conclusion is uncertain.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{Uncertain}$"], "answers": ["Uncertain"], "reference": "Uncertain", "time_total": 18.843082666397095, "time_llm": 18.84230613708496, "prompt_length": 1903}

Thus, `Ugly(Ben) v Yellow(Ben)` is not necessarily true.\n\nLet's construct a counterexample for Case 2:\nAssume Ben is funny, is not from The Simpsons, is not yellow, and is not ugly.\n`Funny(Ben)` (Premise 6 satisfied)\n`~Yellow(Ben)` (Conclusion part `Yellow(Ben)` is false)\n`~Ugly(Ben)` (Conclusion part `Ugly(Ben)` is false)\n\nIf `Funny(Ben)` is true, then `Popular(Ben)` (by 1).\nSince `Popular(Ben)` is true, `~Ugly(Ben)` must be true (by 2).

(If something is ugly, it's not popular, and if it's funny, it's popular, so an ugly thing cannot be funny).\nSo, F(x) and U(x) are mutually exclusive. ~(F(x) ^ U(x)).\n\nFrom (5), (4), (3), (1):\nY(x) -> S(x) -> L(x) -> F(x) -> P(x)\nSo, if Ben is yellow (Y(b)), then Ben is from The Simpsons (S(b)), loved by children (L(b)), funny (F(b)), and popular (P(b)).\nIf Y(b) is true, then F(b) is true.\n\nNow consider premise 6: S(b) V F(b)\n\nCase 1: S(b) is true.\nIf S(b) is true, then from (4), L(b) is true.\nIf L(b) is true, then from (3), F(b) is true.\nIf F(b) is true, then from (1), P(b) is true.\nIf F(b) is true, then U(b) must be false (because F(x) and U(x) are mutually exclusive). So ~U(b).\nIn this case, we have F(b) and ~U(b).\nWhat about Y(b)? S(b) does not imply Y(b). Y(b) implies S(b), but not the other way around. So Y(b) could be true or false.\nIf S(b) is true:\n    - If Y(b) is true: Then Y(b) ^ ~U(b). This fits the \"neither yellow nor ugly\" part if we consider (~Y(b) ^ ~U(b)) as equivalent to ~(Y(b) V U(b)). No, this is not correct. It fits the second disjunct if Y(b) is false.\n    - If Y(b) is false: Then ~Y(b) ^ ~U(b). This fits the second disjunct of the conclusion.\n\nCase 2: F(b) is true (and S(b) might be false).\nIf F(b) is true, then from (1), P(b) is true.\nAs established earlier, if F(b) is true, then U(b) must be false (~U(b)).\nWhat about Y(b)? F(b) does not imply Y(b). Y(b) implies F(b), but not the other way around. So Y(b) could be true or false.\nIf F(b) is true:\n    - If Y(b) is true: Then Y(b) ^ ~U(b). This does not fit either disjunct of the conclusion. The conclusion is (Y(b) ^ U(b)) V (~Y(b) ^ ~U(b)). Our finding is Y(b) ^ ~U(b). This is not (Y(b) ^ U(b)) because U(b) is false. This is not (~Y(b) ^ ~U(b)) because Y(b) is true.\n    - If Y(b) is false: Then ~Y(b) ^ ~U(b). This fits the second disjunct of the conclusion.\n\nLet's combine the cases based on the conclusion structure: (Y(b) ^ U(b)) V (~Y(b) ^ ~U(b)).\nThis conclusion states that Ben is either both yellow and ugly, or neither yellow nor ugly.\nWe know that F(x) and U(x) are mutually exclusive. Since Y(x) -> S(x) -> L(x) -> F(x), if Y(b) is true, then F(b) is true.\nIf F(b) is true, then U(b) must be false.\nSo, if Y(b) is true, then U(b) must be false.\nThis means (Y(b) ^ U(b)) is impossible. (Y(b) is true and U(b) is true cannot happen together, because Y(b) implies F(b), and F(b) excludes U(b)).\nTherefore, the first part of the conclusion (Y(b) ^ U(b)) is always false.\n\nSo, for the conclusion to be true, the second part (~Y(b) ^ ~U(b)) must be true.\nThis means we need to prove that Ben is neither yellow nor ugly.\n\nWe already know that U(b) implies ~P(b) and F(b) implies P(b).\nAlso Y(b) -> F(b) (via S(b) and L(b)).\nSo, if Y(b) is true, then F(b) is true, which means U(b) must be false.\nTherefore, if Y(b) is true, then U(b) is false. So Y(b) ^ U(b) is always false.\n\nNow let's revisit premise 6: S(b) V F(b).\n\nPossibility 1: S(b) is true.\nIf S(b), then L(b) (by 4), then F(b) (by 3).\nIf F(b), then P(b) (by 1).\nIf F(b), then ~U(b) (since F and U are mutually exclusive).\nSo, if S(b) is true, then F(b) is true and ~U(b) is true.\nIn this case, Ben is not ugly (~U(b)).\nCan Ben be yellow (Y(b))? S(b) does not tell us if Y(b) is true or false.\nIf Y(b) is true, then we have Y(b) and ~U(b). This does not fit (~Y(b) ^ ~U(b)).\nIf Y(b) is false, then we have ~Y(b) and ~U(b). This fits (~Y(b) ^ ~U(b)).\n\nPossibility 2: F(b) is true (and S(b) could be false).\nIf F(b) is true, then P(b) is true (by 1).\nIf F(b) is true, then ~U(b) is true (mutually exclusive).\nSo, if F(b) is true, then ~U(b) is true.\nIn this case, Ben is not ugly (~U(b)).\nCan Ben be yellow (Y(b))? F(b) does not tell us if Y(b) is true or false.\nIf Y(b) is true, then we have Y(b) and ~U(b). This does not fit (~Y(b) ^ ~U(b)).\nIf Y(b) is false, then we have ~Y(b) and ~U(b). This fits (~Y(b) ^ ~U(b)).\n\nIn both possibilities derived from premise 6 (S(b) V F(b)), we conclude that ~U(b) is true.\nSo, the conclusion simplifies to: (Y(b) ^ False) V (~Y(b) ^ True) which is equivalent to False V ~Y(b), which means ~Y(b).\nSo, if the conclusion is true, it must be that Ben is not yellow.\n\nLet's re-examine.\nThe conclusion is (Y(b) ^ U(b)) V (~Y(b) ^ ~U(b)).\nWe established that if Y(b) is true, then F(b) is true (via S(b) and L(b)).\nWe also established that if F(b) is true, then U(b) must be false.\nTherefore, it is impossible for Y(b) and U(b) to be true simultaneously. So (Y(b) ^ U(b)) is always false.\nThis means the conclusion simplifies to (~Y(b) ^ ~U(b)).\n\nSo the question is: Does (~Y(b) ^ ~U(b)) follow from the premises?\nFrom premise 6, S(b) V F(b).\n\nIf S(b) is true:\nThen L(b) (by 4).\nThen F(b) (by 3).\nThen P(b) (by 1).\nThen ~U(b) (because F and U are mutually exclusive).\nSo, if S(b) is true, Ben is not ugly (~U(b)).\nHowever, S(b) does not tell us whether Y(b) is true or false.\nIf S(b) is true, Ben could be yellow (Y(b)) or not yellow (~Y(b)).\nIf Y(b) is true, then ~Y(b) is false. So (~Y(b) ^ ~U(b)) would be (false ^ true), which is false.\nIf Y(b) is false, then ~Y(b) is true. So (~Y(b) ^ ~U(b)) would be (true ^ true), which is true.\nSince S(b) allows for Y(b) to be true (e.g., Ben is Bart Simpson, who is yellow and from The Simpsons, and thus funny, popular, and not ugly), the conclusion (~Y(b) ^ ~U(b)) is not necessarily true. If Ben is yellow, then the conclusion is false.\n\nIf F(b) is true:\nThen P(b) (by 1).\nThen ~U(b) (because F and U are mutually exclusive).\nSo, if F(b) is true, Ben is not ugly (~U(b)).\nHowever, F(b) does not tell us whether Y(b) is true or false.\nIf F(b) is true, Ben could be yellow (Y(b)) or not yellow (~Y(b)).\nIf Y(b) is true, then ~Y(b) is false. So (~Y(b) ^ ~U(b)) would be (false ^ true), which is false.\nIf Y(b) is false, then ~Y(b) is true. So (~Y(b) ^ ~U(b)) would be (true ^ true), which is true.\nAgain, F(b) allows for Y(b) to be true (e.g., Bart Simpson is funny, and he is yellow). If Ben is yellow, the conclusion is false.\n\nSince the conclusion simplifies to (~Y(b) ^ ~U(b)), and we found that U(b) must be false in all cases covered by premise 6, the conclusion essentially boils down to ~Y(b).\nWe need to determine if Ben is necessarily not yellow.\nPremise 6 is S(b) V F(b).\nWe know Y(b) -> S(b) -> L(b) -> F(b).\nIf Ben is yellow (Y(b)), then S(b) is true and F(b) is true. In this case, premise 6 (S(b) V F(b)) is satisfied.\nSo, it is possible for Ben to be yellow and satisfy all premises.\nIf Ben is yellow (Y(b) is true), then the conclusion (~Y(b) ^ ~U(b)) is (False ^ ~U(b)), which is False.\nSince it is possible for the conclusion to be false while the premises are true (e.g., if Ben is Bart Simpson), the conclusion does not necessarily follow.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is uncertain.\n\nLet's re-verify:\nPremises:\n1. F(x) -> P(x)\n2. U(x) -> ~P(x)  => F(x) and U(x) are mutually exclusive: ~(F(x) ^ U(x))\n3. L(x) -> F(x)\n4. S(x) -> L(x)\n5. Y(x) -> S(x)\n6. S(b) V F(b)\n\nConclusion: (Y(b) ^ U(b)) V (~Y(b) ^ ~U(b))\n\nChain of implications from Y(x):\nY(x) -> S(x) (5) -> L(x) (4) -> F(x) (3) -> P(x) (1)\nSo, Y(x) -> F(x).\n\nFrom ~(F(x) ^ U(x)), if F(x) is true, then U(x) must be false.\nSince Y(x) -> F(x), if Y(x) is true, then F(x) is true, which implies U(x) is false.\nSo, Y(x) -> ~U(x).\n\nNow let's look at the conclusion: (Y(b) ^ U(b)) V (~Y(b) ^ ~U(b)).\nSince Y(b) -> ~U(b), it means that (Y(b) ^ U(b)) is a contradiction (Y(b) ^ U(b) is equivalent to Y(b) ^ ~U(b) ^ U(b), which is false).\nSo, the first part of the conclusion (Y(b) ^ U(b)) is always false given the premises.\nTherefore, the conclusion simplifies to (~Y(b) ^ ~U(b)).\n\nNow we need to check if (~Y(b) ^ ~U(b)) must be true given premise 6: S(b) V F(b).\n\nCase A: S(b) is true.\nIf S(b), then by (4) L(b).\nIf L(b), then by (3) F(b).\nIf F(b), then by ~(F(x) ^ U(x)), ~U(b).\nSo, if S(b) is true, then ~U(b) is true. This means Ben is not ugly.\nHowever, S(b) does not force ~Y(b). Ben could be from The Simpsons and be yellow (e.g., Homer Simpson). If Ben is yellow (Y(b) is true), then (~Y(b) ^ ~U(b)) becomes (False ^ True), which is False.\nSince it's possible for Ben to be yellow (and thus satisfy S(b) and F(b) and ~U(b)), the conclusion (~Y(b) ^ ~U(b)) is not necessarily true.\n\nCase B: F(b) is true.\nIf F(b), then by ~(F(x) ^ U(x)), ~U(b).\nSo, if F(b) is true, then ~U(b) is true. This means Ben is not ugly.\nHowever, F(b) does not force ~Y(b). Ben could be funny and yellow (e.g., Bart Simpson is funny and yellow). If Ben is yellow (Y(b) is true), then (~Y(b) ^ ~U(b)) becomes (False ^ True), which is False.\nSince it's possible for Ben to be yellow (and thus satisfy F(b) and ~U(b)), the conclusion (~Y(b) ^ ~U(b)) is not necessarily true.\n\nIn both cases derived from S(b) V F(b), we establish ~U(b). But we cannot establish ~Y(b).\nSince the conclusion simplifies to (~Y(b) ^ ~U(b)), and ~Y(b) is not necessarily true, the entire conclusion is not necessarily true.\nThe conclusion is not necessarily false either, as a non-yellow, non-ugly Ben is possible.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is Uncertain.\n\nFinal check with a counterexample:\nLet Ben be Bart Simpson.\n1. Bart is funny (F(b)).\n2. Bart is popular (P(b)). (F(b) -> P(b) holds)\n3. Bart is not ugly (~U(b)). (U(b) -> ~P(b) holds, since ~P(b) is false, U(b) must be false).\n4.

From Premise 5, we know `NOT Teaches(Jerry)`.\n\n2.  From Premise 3, we know that a person either studies or teaches. Since Jerry is a person (implied by the context of the statements about him), and we know `NOT Teaches(Jerry)`, it must be that `Studies(Jerry)`.\n    *   `Person(Jerry) -> (Studies(Jerry) XOR Teaches(Jerry))`\n    *   Since `NOT Teaches(Jerry)`, it must be `Studies(Jerry)`.\n\n3.  From Premise 4, we know `Young(x) -> NOT Teaches(x)`. This means if someone is young, they do not teach.\n    *   We also know the contrapositive: `Teaches(x) -> NOT Young(x)`.\n\n4.  We have already established `NOT Teaches(Jerry)` from Premise 5.\n    *   Premise 4 states `Young(x) -> NOT Teaches(x)`.\n    *   The fact that Jerry does not teach (`NOT Teaches(Jerry)`) *does not* automatically mean Jerry is not young. If Jerry is young, then he doesn't teach, which is consistent. If Jerry is not young, then he also doesn't teach, which is also consistent.\n    *   Consider an analogy: \"All birds can fly.\" (Bird -> CanFly). If something cannot fly (NOT CanFly), then it's not a bird (NOT Bird). But if something *can* fly, it doesn't mean it *is* a bird (e.g., a plane can fly).\n    *   Similarly, `Young(Jerry) -> NOT Teaches(Jerry)`. We know `NOT Teaches(Jerry)`. This doesn't force `NOT Young(Jerry)`. It only means that if Jerry *were* young, he wouldn't teach, which is consistent with what we know.\n\n5.  The information that Jerry studies (`Studies(Jerry)`) from step 2, and that `Studies(x) -> Student(x)` from Premise 2, tells us `Student(Jerry)`.\n    *   And `Student(Jerry) -> Human(Jerry)` from Premise 1. So, `Human(Jerry)`. This doesn't help with `Young(Jerry)`.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the connection between `NOT Teaches(Jerry)` and `Young(Jerry)`.\nPremise 4: `Young(x) -> NOT Teaches(x)`.\nThis means if someone *is* young, they *cannot* teach.\nWe know Jerry `NOT Teaches(Jerry)`. This fact is *consistent* with Jerry being young (`Young(Jerry)`). It is also consistent with Jerry *not* being young (`NOT Young(Jerry)`).\nFor example, if Jerry is 5 years old (young), he doesn't teach. This fits.\nIf Jerry is 50 years old (not young), he also doesn't teach. This also fits.\n\nTherefore, knowing that Jerry does not teach does not allow us to conclude whether he is young or not.\n\nThe premises do not provide enough information to definitively conclude that Jerry is not young.\n\nANSWER: Uncertain"], "answers": ["Uncertain"], "reference": "Uncertain", "time_total": 8.198150873184204, "time_llm": 8.19778037071228, "prompt_length": 1558}

This tells us that Remy *does not* work regularly and often at home.\n\nThe conclusion states `VisitsOfficeSupplyStoreRegularly(Remy)`.\n\nFrom premise 4: `WorksRegularlyAndOftenAtHome(Remy) => VisitsOfficeSupplyStoreRegularly(Remy)`.\nSince `WorksRegularlyAndOftenAtHome(Remy)` is false, we cannot directly infer anything about `VisitsOfficeSupplyStoreRegularly(Remy)` from this implication. An implication `P => Q` is true if P is false, regardless of Q's truth value.

(This is the XOR relation as stated before).\n\n    From Premise 5: If `SpendsFreeTimeTidying(Remy)` is True, then `GoToBedLateWakeUpAfterNoon(Remy)` must be False. This combination (`SpendsFreeTimeTidying(Remy)` True AND `GoToBedLateWakeUpAfterNoon(Remy)` False) is consistent with the second part of the XOR in Premise 6.\n\n    What if `SpendsFreeTimeTidying(Remy)` is False?\n    If `SpendsFreeTimeTidying(Remy)` is False, then from Premise 6, `GoToBedLateWakeUpAfterNoon(Remy)` must be True. (This is the first part of the XOR).\n    However, Premise 5 `SpendsFreeTimeTidying(Remy) -> NOT GoToBedLateWakeUpAfterNoon(Remy)` doesn't directly contradict this. The contrapositive of Premise 5 is `GoToBedLateWakeUpAfterNoon(Remy) -> NOT SpendsFreeTimeTidying(Remy)`.\n    So, if `GoToBedLateWakeUpAfterNoon(Remy)` is True (as implied by the first part of the XOR in Premise 6 if `SpendsFreeTimeTidying(Remy)` is False), then `NOT SpendsFreeTimeTidying(Remy)` must be True. This is consistent.\n\n    So, both cases allowed by Premise 6 are still possible *just considering Premise 5*.\n    Case A: `GoToBedLateWakeUpAfterNoon(Remy)` is True AND `SpendsFreeTimeTidying(Remy)` is False.\n    Case B: `GoToBedLateWakeUpAfterNoon(Remy)` is False AND `SpendsFreeTimeTidying(Remy)` is True.\n\n3.  **Deduce `SpendsFreeTimeTidying(Remy)`:**\n    If Case A were true: `GoToBedLateWakeUpAfterNoon(Remy)` is True.\n    If Case B were true: `SpendsFreeTimeTidying(Remy)` is True.\n\n    Let's reconsider Premise 5: `SpendsFreeTimeTidying(X) -> NOT GoToBedLateWakeUpAfterNoon(X)`.\n    If `SpendsFreeTimeTidying(Remy)` is True, then `GoToBedLateWakeUpAfterNoon(Remy)` must be False. This aligns perfectly with Case B.\n    If `SpendsFreeTimeTidying(Remy)` is False, then Premise 5 tells us nothing about `GoToBedLateWakeUpAfterNoon(Remy)`. However, if `SpendsFreeTimeTidying(Remy)` is False, then from Premise 6, `GoToBedLateWakeUpAfterNoon(Remy)` *must* be True.\n    So, we have two consistent scenarios:\n    Scenario 1: `SpendsFreeTimeTidying(Remy)` is True AND `GoToBedLateWakeUpAfterNoon(Remy)` is False. (This satisfies Premise 5: T -> F, and Premise 6: (F AND T) OR (T AND F) is true, so XOR is true).\n    Scenario 2: `SpendsFreeTimeTidying(Remy)` is False AND `GoToBedLateWakeUpAfterNoon(Remy)` is True. (This satisfies Premise 5: F -> ?, no contradiction. And Premise 6: (T AND F) OR (F AND T) is true, so XOR is true).\n\n    My previous analysis of Premise 6 was incorrect in stating that it implies `GoToBedLateWakeUpAfterNoon(Remy) IFF SpendsFreeTimeTidying(Remy)` is FALSE. This is correct.\n    This means `(GoToBedLateWakeUpAfterNoon(Remy) AND NOT SpendsFreeTimeTidying(Remy)) OR (NOT GoToBedLateWakeUpAfterNoon(Remy) AND SpendsFreeTimeTidying(Remy))` is TRUE.\n\n    Now, combine with Premise 5: `SpendsFreeTimeTidying(Remy) -> NOT GoToBedLateWakeUpAfterNoon(Remy)`.\n    Let `A = SpendsFreeTimeTidying(Remy)` and `B = GoToBedLateWakeUpAfterNoon(Remy)`.\n    Premise 5: `A -> NOT B` (or `NOT A OR NOT B`)\n    Premise 6: `(B AND NOT A) OR (NOT B AND A)`\n\n    Let's check the truth table for (A, B) combinations:\n    *   (T, T): Premise 5: T -> F (False). So (T, T) is impossible.\n    *   (T, F): Premise 5: T -> T (True). Premise 6: (F AND F) OR (T AND T) = F OR T = T (True). This combination is possible.\n    *   (F, T): Premise 5: F -> F (True). Premise 6: (T AND T) OR (F AND F) = T OR F = T (True). This combination is possible.\n    *   (F, F): Premise 5: F -> T (True). Premise 6: (T AND F) OR (F AND T) = F OR F = F (False). So (F, F) is impossible.\n\n    So, Remy must be in one of these two states:\n    *   State 1: `SpendsFreeTimeTidying(Remy)` is True AND `GoToBedLateWakeUpAfterNoon(Remy)` is False.\n    *   State 2: `SpendsFreeTimeTidying(Remy)` is False AND `GoToBedLateWakeUpAfterNoon(Remy)` is True.\n\n4.  **Connect to `WorkRegularlyAtHome(Remy)`:**\n    *   From Premise 3: `WorkRegularlyAtHome(X) -> SpendsFreeTimeTidying(X)`\n        *   If `SpendsFreeTimeTidying(Remy)` is False (State 2), then `WorkRegularlyAtHome(Remy)` must also be False (by contrapositive of Premise 3).\n    *   From Premise 4: `WorkRegularlyAtHome(X) -> VisitsOfficeSupplyStore(X)`\n        *   If `WorkRegularlyAtHome(Remy)` is False (as in State 2), then we cannot conclude anything about `VisitsOfficeSupplyStore(Remy)` from this premise alone. It could be true or false.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Conclusion:** `HasImpressiveHomeOffice(Remy) AND VisitsOfficeSupplyStore(Remy)`\n\n    *   **Part 1: `HasImpressiveHomeOffice(Remy)`**\n        *   From Premise 2: `HasImpressiveHomeOffice(X) -> OwnLargeDesktopMonitor(X)`\n        *   From Premise 1: `OwnLargeDesktopMonitor(X) -> WorkRegularlyAtHome(X)`\n        *   Therefore, by transitivity: `HasImpressiveHomeOffice(X) -> WorkRegularlyAtHome(X)`\n        *   And further, combining with Premise 3: `HasImpressiveHomeOffice(X) -> SpendsFreeTimeTidying(X)`\n\n        *   If Remy has an impressive home office (`HasImpressiveHomeOffice(Remy)` is True), then Remy must `SpendsFreeTimeTidying(Remy)`. This means we are in State 1 (`SpendsFreeTimeTidying(Remy)` is True AND `GoToBedLateWakeUpAfterNoon(Remy)` is False).\n        *   If Remy `SpendsFreeTimeTidying(Remy)` is False (State 2), then Remy cannot `HasImpressiveHomeOffice(Remy)`.\n\n    *   **Part 2: `VisitsOfficeSupplyStore(Remy)`**\n        *   From Premise 4: `WorkRegularlyAtHome(X) -> VisitsOfficeSupplyStore(X)`\n        *   If Remy `WorkRegularlyAtHome(Remy)` is True, then Remy `VisitsOfficeSupplyStore(Remy)` is True.\n        *   If Remy `WorkRegularlyAtHome(Remy)` is False, then we don't know if Remy `VisitsOfficeSupplyStore(Remy)`.\n\n6.  **Can we definitively say `HasImpressiveHomeOffice(Remy)` is True?**\n    *   No. We know Remy is either in State 1 or State 2.\n    *   If Remy is in State 2 (`SpendsFreeTimeTidying(Remy)` is False), then `HasImpressiveHomeOffice(Remy)` must be False (because if it were true, `SpendsFreeTimeTidying(Remy)` would be true).\n    *   So, `HasImpressiveHomeOffice(Remy)` is not necessarily true.\n\n7.  **Can we definitively say `VisitsOfficeSupplyStore(Remy)` is True?**\n    *   If Remy is in State 1 (`SpendsFreeTimeTidying(Remy)` is True), then `WorkRegularlyAtHome(Remy)` *could* be True. If `WorkRegularlyAtHome(Remy)` is True, then `VisitsOfficeSupplyStore(Remy)` is True.\n    *   If Remy is in State 2 (`SpendsFreeTimeTidying(Remy)` is False), then `WorkRegularlyAtHome(Remy)` must be False. In this case, Premise 4 `WorkRegularlyAtHome(X) -> VisitsOfficeSupplyStore(X)` doesn't tell us if `VisitsOfficeSupplyStore(Remy)` is true or false.\n\n    We have two possible states for Remy:\n    *   **State 1:** `SpendsFreeTimeTidying(Remy)` is True AND `GoToBedLateWakeUpAfterNoon(Remy)` is False.\n        *   From P3: `WorkRegularlyAtHome(Remy)` *could* be True (if so, P3 is T->T), or False (if so, P3 is F->T, still true). We cannot definitively say `WorkRegularlyAtHome(Remy)` is True.\n        *   If `WorkRegularlyAtHome(Remy)` is True, then `VisitsOfficeSupplyStore(Remy)` is True.\n        *   If `WorkRegularlyAtHome(Remy)` is False, then `VisitsOfficeSupplyStore(Remy)` is uncertain.\n    *   **State 2:** `SpendsFreeTimeTidying(Remy)` is False AND `GoToBedLateWakeUpAfterNoon(Remy)` is True.\n        *   From P3 (contrapositive): `NOT SpendsFreeTimeTidying(Remy) -> NOT WorkRegularlyAtHome(Remy)`. So, `WorkRegularlyAtHome(Remy)` is False.\n        *   Since `WorkRegularlyAtHome(Remy)` is False, Premise 4 (`WorkRegularlyAtHome(X) -> VisitsOfficeSupplyStore(X)`) is `False -> VisitsOfficeSupplyStore(Remy)`, which is always true regardless of `VisitsOfficeSupplyStore(Remy)`'s truth value. So `VisitsOfficeSupplyStore(Remy)` is uncertain.\n        *   Also, since `WorkRegularlyAtHome(Remy)` is False, then `OwnLargeDesktopMonitor(Remy)` is False (from P1 contrapositive).\n        *   And `HasImpressiveHomeOffice(Remy)` is False (from P2 contrapositive).\n\n    In State 2, Remy *does not* have an impressive home office (`HasImpressiveHomeOffice(Remy)` is False).

This is equivalent to `GoesToBedLateAndWakesUpLate(Remy) <=> TidiesAtHome(Remy)`.\n\n**Let's use abbreviations for Remy:**\n\n*   `M`: OwnLargeMonitor(Remy)\n*   `I`: HasImpressiveOffice(Remy)\n*   `W`: WorksRegularlyAtHome(Remy)\n*   `T`: TidiesAtHome(Remy)\n*   `V`: VisitsOfficeSupplyStore(Remy)\n*   `L`: GoesToBedLateAndWakesUpLate(Remy)\n\n**Rewriting premises for Remy:**\n\n1.  `M => W`\n2.  `I => M`\n3.  `W => T`\n4.  `W => V`\n5.  `T => NOT(L)`\n6.  `L <=> T` (from simplification of premise 6)\n\n**Analyzing Premise 6 (`L <=> T`):**\n\n*   This means `(L AND T) OR (NOT L AND NOT T)`.\n\n**Now, let's look at Premise 5 (`T => NOT(L)`):**\n\n*   If `T` is true, then `NOT(L)` must be true.\n*   But from `L <=> T`, if `T` is true, then `L` must also be true.\n*   This creates a contradiction: `L` must be true and `NOT(L)` must be true simultaneously.\n*   This means the premises are inconsistent unless `T` is false.\n*   If `T` is false, then `NOT(T)` is true.\n*   From `L <=> T`, if `NOT(T)` is true, then `NOT(L)` must be true.\n*   From `T => NOT(L)`, if `T` is false, the implication is vacuously true (`False => X` is always true), so it doesn't contradict `NOT(L)`.\n*   Therefore, for consistency, `T` must be false, and `L` must be false.\n\n**So, from the premises, we can deduce:**\n\n*   `NOT(T)` (Remy does not tidy at home)\n*   `NOT(L)` (Remy does not go to bed late and wake up late)\n\n**Now, let's use these deductions and other premises:**\n\n*   From `NOT(T)` and `W => T` (premise 3), by contrapositive, `NOT(T) => NOT(W)`. So, `NOT(W)` (Remy does not work regularly at home).\n*   From `NOT(W)` and `W => V` (premise 4), we cannot deduce anything about `V`. `False => V` is always true. So `V` can be true or false.\n*   From `NOT(W)` and `M => W` (premise 1), by contrapositive, `NOT(W) => NOT(M)`. So, `NOT(M)` (Remy does not own a large desktop monitor).\n*   From `NOT(M)` and `I => M` (premise 2), by contrapositive, `NOT(M) => NOT(I)`. So, `NOT(I)` (Remy does not have a fully stocked and impressive home office).\n\n**Summary of what we know about Remy from the premises:**\n\n*   `NOT(T)` (Remy does not spend free time tidying)\n*   `NOT(L)` (Remy does not go to bed late and wake up late)\n*   `NOT(W)` (Remy does not work regularly at home)\n*   `NOT(M)` (Remy does not own a large desktop monitor)\n*   `NOT(I)` (Remy does not have a fully stocked and impressive home office)\n*   `V` is **uncertain** (Remy may or may not visit the office supply store regularly).\n\n**Conclusion to evaluate:**\n\n`If (L OR V), then (NOT(T) AND NOT(I))`\n\nLet's substitute what we know:\n\n*   We know `NOT(L)` is true, so `L` is false.\n*   We know `NOT(T)` is true.\n*   We know `NOT(I)` is true.\n\nSo the conclusion becomes:\n\n`If (False OR V), then (True AND True)`\n`If V, then True`\n\nSince `V` is uncertain, let's consider both cases:\n\n**Case 1: V is True**\n*   If `V` is true, then `If True, then True` which is `True`.\n\n**Case 2: V is False**\n*   If `V` is false, then `If False, then True` which is `True` (vacuously true).\n\nIn both possible cases for `V`, the conclusion `If V, then True` evaluates to `True`.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion follows from the premises.\n\nLet's double-check the initial inconsistency detection.\nPremise 5: `T => NOT L`\nPremise 6: `(L AND T) OR (NOT L AND NOT T)` which means `L <=> T`\n\nIf `T` is true:\nFrom P6 (`L <=> T`), `L` must be true.\nFrom P5 (`T => NOT L`), `NOT L` must be true.\nThis is a contradiction (`L` and `NOT L`). So `T` cannot be true.\n\nTherefore, `T` must be false.\nIf `T` is false:\nFrom P6 (`L <=> T`), `L` must be false.\nFrom P5 (`T => NOT L`), `False => NOT L` is true regardless of `L`. This is consistent.\n\nSo, it is definitively established that `T` is false and `L` is false.\n\nNow, let's trace the implications:\n1. `T` is false.\n2. From `W => T` (P3), if `T` is false, then `W` must be false (contrapositive). So, `W` is false.\n3. From `W => V` (P4), if `W` is false, this premise is `False => V`, which is always true. So `V` can be true or false. We cannot determine `V`.\n4. From `M => W` (P1), if `W` is false, then `M` must be false. So, `M` is false.\n5. From `I => M` (P2), if `M` is false, then `I` must be false. So, `I` is false.\n\nSo, we know for Remy:\n*   `L` is false.\n*   `T` is false.\n*   `I` is false.\n*   `V` is uncertain.\n\nThe conclusion is: `(L OR V) => (NOT T AND NOT I)`\n\nSubstitute the known values:\n`(False OR V) => (NOT False AND NOT False)`\n`V => (True AND True)`\n`V => True`\n\nThis implication `V => True` is always true, regardless of whether `V` is true or false.\n*   If `V` is true, then `True => True`, which is true.\n*   If `V` is false, then `False => True`, which is true.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{True}$"], "answers": ["True"], "reference": "True", "time_total": 10.9440758228302, "time_llm": 10.943466186523438, "prompt_length": 2448}

Let's look at what we know about Jack from premise 7:\n*   `Student(Jack)`\n*   `\u00acHasPartTimeJob(Jack)`\n*   `\u00acWorksInLab(Jack)`\n\nNow, let's see if any of the other premises can lead us to `TakesDatabaseCourse(Jack)`.\n\n*   **Premise 4:** `InstructedByDavid(x) \u2192 TakesDatabaseCourse(x)`\n    If we can prove `InstructedByDavid(Jack)`, then we can conclude `TakesDatabaseCourse(Jack)`.\n\n*   **Premise 5:** `WorksInLab(x) \u2192 InstructedByDavid(x)`\n    If we can prove `WorksInLab(Jack)`, then we can conclude `InstructedByDavid(Jack)`.\n    However, premise 7 explicitly states `\u00acWorksInLab(Jack)`. So, we cannot use this path to infer `InstructedByDavid(Jack)`.\n\nSince `\u00acWorksInLab(Jack)` is given, we cannot use the chain `WorksInLab(Jack) \u2192 InstructedByDavid(Jack) \u2192 TakesDatabaseCourse(Jack)`.\n\nAre there any other ways to infer `TakesDatabaseCourse(Jack)`?\nPremise 3 states `TakesDatabaseCourse(x) \u2192 FromCSDept(x)`. This tells us something *about* students who take the database course, but it doesn't help us determine if Jack takes the database course. It's a conditional in the wrong direction for direct inference of `TakesDatabaseCourse(Jack)`.\n\nLet's consider the contrapositive of some premises:\n*   From Premise 3: `\u00acFromCSDept(x) \u2192 \u00acTakesDatabaseCourse(x)`\n    If we knew Jack was *not* from the CS department, we could conclude he doesn't take the database course.\n\n*   From Premise 1: `WorksInLibrary(x) \u2192 \u00acFromCSDept(x)`\n    From Premise 2: `HasPartTimeJob(x) \u2192 WorksInLibrary(x)`\n    Combining these: `HasPartTimeJob(x) \u2192 \u00acFromCSDept(x)`\n    From Premise 7, we know `\u00acHasPartTimeJob(Jack)`. This means we cannot use this path to infer `\u00acFromCSDept(Jack)`. The absence of a part-time job doesn't tell us whether Jack works in the library or is from the CS department.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWe are given specific negative information about Jack: he does not have a part-time job and does not work in the lab. This information prevents us from using the chains of inference that would lead to him taking the database course (via `WorksInLab` or `HasPartTimeJob`). The premises do not provide any positive information or alternative paths to conclude that Jack takes the database course. The fact that he *doesn't* have a part-time job or work in the lab means he *doesn't* fall into the categories that would lead to him taking the database course *based on the given rules*.\n\nHowever, the conclusion asks if he *does* take the database course. We have no information that forces this to be true. We also have no information that forces it to be false. For instance, Jack could be a student from the CS department who takes the database course, but doesn't have a part-time job and doesn't work in the lab. The premises don't exclude this possibility.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion `Jack takes the database course` cannot be definitively proven true or false from the given premises.\n\nANSWER: Uncertain"], "answers": ["Uncertain"], "reference": "Uncertain", "time_total": 7.336349725723267, "time_llm": 7.335898399353027, "prompt_length": 1897}

Let's look for connections to `ColorectalCancer`.\n\nPremise 6 is the only premise that directly mentions `ColorectalCancer`.\nPremise 6 states: `(BileDuctCancer(ColorectalCancer) AND LowSurvivalRate(ColorectalCancer)) -> NOT BileDuctCancer(ColorectalCancer)`\n\nThis premise is a conditional statement where the consequent (`NOT BileDuctCancer(ColorectalCancer)`) directly contradicts one of the conjuncts in the antecedent (`BileDuctCancer(ColorectalCancer)`).\n\nLet `A` be `BileDuctCancer(ColorectalCancer)` and `B` be `LowSurvivalRate(ColorectalCancer)`.\nThe premise can be written as `(A AND B) -> NOT A`.\n\nIf `A` were true and `B` were true, then `A AND B` would be true. This would imply `NOT A`. But if `A` is true, `NOT A` is false. This creates a contradiction (`true -> false`).\nTherefore, the antecedent `(A AND B)` must be false.\n\nThis means that it is not the case that both `BileDuctCancer(ColorectalCancer)` and `LowSurvivalRate(ColorectalCancer)` are true.\nSo, `NOT (BileDuctCancer(ColorectalCancer) AND LowSurvivalRate(ColorectalCancer))` must be true.\nThis is equivalent to `NOT BileDuctCancer(ColorectalCancer) OR NOT LowSurvivalRate(ColorectalCancer)`.\n\nThis tells us something about Colorectal Cancer, but it doesn't directly tell us if it's a severe cancer.\n\nLet's re-examine the relationships between concepts:\n*   `SevereCancer -> DeadlyDisease` (P2)\n*   `DeadlyDisease -> LowSurvivalRate` (P1)\n*   Combining P1 and P2: `SevereCancer -> LowSurvivalRate` (by transitivity)\n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion: `SevereCancer(ColorectalCancer)`.\nIf `SevereCancer(ColorectalCancer)` were true, then from `SevereCancer -> LowSurvivalRate`, it would imply `LowSurvivalRate(ColorectalCancer)`.\n\nHowever, we know from P6 that `NOT (BileDuctCancer(ColorectalCancer) AND LowSurvivalRate(ColorectalCancer))`.\n\nThe premises do not provide any direct or indirect information that forces Colorectal cancer to be a severe cancer.

The structure of premise 6 only forces the antecedent to be false, meaning we cannot have both `BileDuctCancer(ColorectalCancer)` and `LowSurvivalRate(ColorectalCancer)` be true. This does not help us determine if `SevereCancer(ColorectalCancer)` is true or false.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude whether Colorectal cancer is a severe cancer based on the given premises.\n\nThe information about Bile Duct Cancer being a severe cancer (P3) and Cholangiocarcinoma being a Bile Duct Cancer (P4) applies to Cholangiocarcinoma, not necessarily to Colorectal cancer.\n\nConclusion: The premises do not provide enough information to determine if Colorectal cancer is a severe cancer.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{Uncertain}$"], "answers": ["Uncertain"], "reference": "Uncertain", "time_total": 6.901769399642944, "time_llm": 6.901305198669434, "prompt_length": 1732}

If colorectal cancer is a bile duct cancer, it has a low survival rate. If it's a mild flu, it doesn't have a low survival rate. Therefore, it cannot be both.\n\nSince the consequent \"colorectal cancer is a bile duct cancer and a mild flu\" is logically false (a contradiction) based on the premises, then for the entire conditional statement to be true, the antecedent \"colorectal cancer is a bile duct cancer or a Cholangiocarcinoma\" must also be false.\n\nHowever, the conclusion is a conditional statement. If the consequent is always false, then the conditional \"If A then False\" is only true if A is false. We cannot definitively say if A is false. We don't have enough information to say whether colorectal cancer is a bile duct cancer or a Cholangiocarcinoma.\n\nLet's reconsider. A conditional statement \"If P then Q\" is false only if P is true AND Q is false.\nWe have established that Q (\"colorectal cancer is a bile duct cancer and a mild flu\") is false. This is because if it's bile duct cancer, it has a low survival rate (from 3, 2, 1). If it's mild flu, it does NOT have a low survival rate (from 5). These two conditions (low survival rate and not low survival rate) are contradictory. Therefore, \"colorectal cancer is a bile duct cancer and a mild flu\" is a logical impossibility given the premises.\n\nSince the consequent of the conclusion is false, the only way for the entire conclusion to be true is if the antecedent is also false. However, we cannot definitively say whether \"colorectal cancer is a bile duct cancer or a Cholangiocarcinoma\" is false. We simply don't have enough information about colorectal cancer to make that determination.\n\nBecause the conclusion is a conditional statement whose consequent is necessarily false, the truth value of the entire conditional depends on the truth value of its antecedent.

(Consistent with our assumption for this case)\n*   From (GrewUpHealthConsciousHome(Taylor) and premise 2): `EatsSaladsRegularly(Taylor)` is true.\n*   However, from (GoodRelationshipParents(Taylor) and premise 5): `\u00acEatsSaladsRegularly(Taylor)` is true.\n*   This creates a contradiction: `EatsSaladsRegularly(Taylor)` AND `\u00acEatsSaladsRegularly(Taylor)`.\n*   Therefore, Case 1 is impossible given the premises.\n\nSince Case 1 leads to a contradiction, it must be false.

(The antecedent of the contrapositive is not given).\n    If Taylor did eat salads regularly, then she must have grown up in a health-conscious home (from P2). But we know she didn't. Therefore, she cannot eat salads regularly.\n    So, if `GrewUpHealthConsciousHome(Taylor)` is false, then `EatsSaladsRegularly(Taylor)` must also be false.

We have two cases:\n\n**Case 1: `GrewUpHealthConsciousHome(Taylor) \u2227 GoodRelationshipParents(Taylor)`**\n\n*   If `GoodRelationshipParents(Taylor)` is true (from this case), then from Premise 4, `FulfillsNutritionalIntakes(Taylor)` is true.\n*   If `FulfillsNutritionalIntakes(Taylor)` is true, then from Premise 3, `GrewUpHealthConsciousHome(Taylor)` is true. (This is consistent with our assumption for Case 1).\n*   If `GrewUpHealthConsciousHome(Taylor)` is true, then from Premise 2, `EatsSaladsRegularly(Taylor)` is true.\n*   However, if `GoodRelationshipParents(Taylor)` is true, then from Premise 5, `\u00acEatsSaladsRegularly(Taylor)` is true.\n\nThis creates a contradiction: `EatsSaladsRegularly(Taylor)` and `\u00acEatsSaladsRegularly(Taylor)` cannot both be true simultaneously.\nTherefore, **Case 1 (`GrewUpHealthConsciousHome(Taylor) \u2227 GoodRelationshipParents(Taylor)`) is impossible.**\n\n**Case 2: `\u00acGrewUpHealthConsciousHome(Taylor) \u2227 \u00acGoodRelationshipParents(Taylor)`**\n\nSince Case 1 leads to a contradiction, Premise 7 forces us to conclude that Case 2 must be true for Taylor.\nSo, we know for sure:\n*   `\u00acGrewUpHealthConsciousHome(Taylor)` (Taylor neither grew up in a health-conscious childhood home)\n*   `\u00acGoodRelationshipParents(Taylor)` (Taylor does not have a good relationship with her parents)\n\nNow, let's check the second part of the conclusion: `\u00acVisitsGymDaily(Taylor)`.\n\n*   We know `\u00acGoodRelationshipParents(Taylor)`.\n*   From Premise 4: `GoodRelationshipParents(Taylor) \u2192 FulfillsNutritionalIntakes(Taylor)`. Since the antecedent `GoodRelationshipParents(Taylor)` is false, this premise tells us nothing about `FulfillsNutritionalIntakes(Taylor)`. Taylor *might or might not* fulfill her nutritional intakes.\n*   From Premise 6: `VisitsGymDaily(Taylor) \u2192 FulfillsNutritionalIntakes(Taylor)`.\n    *   If `VisitsGymDaily(Taylor)` were true, then `FulfillsNutritionalIntakes(Taylor)` would be true.\n    *   We don't know if `FulfillsNutritionalIntakes(Taylor)` is true or false.\n\nLet's see if `VisitsGymDaily(Taylor)` can be true.\nIf `VisitsGymDaily(Taylor)` is true, then by P6, `FulfillsNutritionalIntakes(Taylor)` is true.\nIf `FulfillsNutritionalIntakes(Taylor)` is true, then by P3, `GrewUpHealthConsciousHome(Taylor)` is true.\nBut from Case 2, which we established must be true, we know `\u00acGrewUpHealthConsciousHome(Taylor)`.\n\nThis means:\nIf `VisitsGymDaily(Taylor)` is true \u2192 `GrewUpHealthConsciousHome(Taylor)` (via P6 and P3).\nBut we know `\u00acGrewUpHealthConsciousHome(Taylor)` from Case 2.\nTherefore, `VisitsGymDaily(Taylor)` must be false.\n\nSo, we have:\n1.  `\u00acGrewUpHealthConsciousHome(Taylor)` (established from Case 2, which is the only consistent option from P7)\n2.  `\u00acVisitsGymDaily(Taylor)` (derived from the contradiction that `VisitsGymDaily(Taylor)` would lead to `GrewUpHealthConsciousHome(Taylor)`, which is false).\n\nBoth parts of the conclusion are true based on the premises.\n\nThe conclusion is `\u00acGrewUpHealthConsciousHome(Taylor) \u2227 \u00acVisitsGymDaily(Taylor)`.\nWe have deduced that `\u00acGrewUpHealthConsciousHome(Taylor)` is true.\nWe have deduced that `\u00acVisitsGymDaily(Taylor)` is true.\nTherefore, the conjunction is true.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{True}$"], "answers": ["True"], "reference": "True", "time_total": 8.042585134506226, "time_llm": 8.042076587677002, "prompt_length": 2278}

This is equivalent to `(~C -> ~B)`.\nSo, `(A & B) -> (~C -> ~B)`.\n\nThis is a disjunction: `~(A & B) | (~C -> ~B)`\n`(~A | ~B) | (~C -> ~B)`\n\nLet's look at the implication `(~C -> ~B)`. This is equivalent to `(B -> C)`.\n\nSo, Premise 6 can be rewritten as: `(~Jumps(KiKi) & ~HasLegs(KiKi)) -> (Terricolous(KiKi) | HasLegs(KiKi))`\nLet `P = ~Jumps(KiKi)` and `Q = ~HasLegs(KiKi)`.\nLet `R = Terricolous(KiKi)` and `S = HasLegs(KiKi)`.\nSo, `(P & Q) -> (R | S)`.\nNote that `Q` is `~S`.\nSo, `(P & ~S) -> (R | S)`.\n\nLet's analyze this specific structure `(X & ~Y) -> (Z | Y)`.\nThis statement is a tautology.\nWhy?\nIf `(X & ~Y)` is true, then `~Y` is true, which means `Y` is false.\nIf `Y` is false, then `(Z | Y)` becomes `(Z | false)`, which is just `Z`.\nSo, the implication becomes `(X & ~Y) -> Z`.\n\nHowever, the general form `(A & B) -> (C | D)` where `B` is `~D` is `(A & ~D) -> (C | D)`.\nIf `~D` is true, then `D` is false.\nSo `(C | D)` becomes `(C | false)`, which is `C`.\nSo the premise simplifies to `(A & ~D) -> C`.\nIn our case, `(~Jumps(KiKi) & ~HasLegs(KiKi)) -> Terricolous(KiKi)`.\n\nLet's re-evaluate Premise 6: `(~Jumps(KiKi) & ~HasLegs(KiKi)) -> (Terricolous(KiKi) | HasLegs(KiKi))`\nLet `J = Jumps(KiKi)`, `L = HasLegs(KiKi)`, `T = Terricolous(KiKi)`.\nSo, `(~J & ~L) -> (T | L)`.\n\nConsider the truth table for `(~J & ~L) -> (T | L)`:\nCase 1: `L` is True.\nThen `~L` is False.\nThe left side `(~J & ~L)` is `(~J & False)`, which is False.\n`False -> (T | L)` is always True, regardless of `T`.\n\nCase 2: `L` is False.\nThen `~L` is True.\nThe left side `(~J & ~L)` is `(~J & True)`, which is `~J`.\nThe right side `(T | L)` is `(T | False)`, which is `T`.\nSo, if `L` is False, Premise 6 simplifies to `~J -> T`.\n\nSo, Premise 6 tells us: `If KiKi does not have legs, then if KiKi does not jump, KiKi is terricolous.`\nOr more simply, `~L -> (~J -> T)`.\nThis is equivalent to `~L -> (J | T)`.\nThis is also equivalent to `(L | J | T)`.\n\nLet's look at the other premises:\n4. `HasLegs(x) -> Jumps(x)` (L -> J)\n5. `Terricolous(x) -> HasLegs(x)` (T -> L)\n\nFrom (T -> L) and (L -> J), by transitivity, we get (T -> J).\nSo, if KiKi is terricolous, then KiKi has legs, and if KiKi has legs, then KiKi jumps.\nTherefore, if KiKi is terricolous, KiKi jumps. (T -> J)\n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion: `Terricolous(KiKi)` (T).\n\nCan we deduce T from the premises?\n\nFrom Premise 6, we know `(L | J | T)`.\nFrom Premise 4, we know `L -> J`. This means `~L | J`.\nFrom Premise 5, we know `T -> L`. This means `~T | L`.\n\nLet's use resolution or chain of implications.\nWe have `T -> L` (P5) and `L -> J` (P4).\nThis implies `T -> J`.\n\nNow let's look at `(L | J | T)`.\nSince `L -> J` is true, if `L` is true, then `J` is true. So `(L | J)` is essentially `J` (if L is true, J is true, so J is true; if L is false, then J might be true or false, so (false | J) is J).\nThis is not quite right. `(L | J)` simplifies to `J` if `L` is a stronger condition than `J`.\n`L -> J` means `~L \\/ J`.\nSo, `(L \\/ J \\/ T)`\nSubstitute `J` with `(L \\/ J)` (since `L -> J` implies `J` covers `L`).\nThis is complex. Let's try to derive a contradiction if `~T` is true.\n\nAssume `~Terricolous(KiKi)` (`~T`) is true.\n\nFrom `~T` and `T -> L` (P5), we cannot conclude anything about `L`. `~T` does not imply `~L`.\nFrom `~T` and `T -> J`, we cannot conclude anything about `J`. `~T` does not imply `~J`.\n\nLet's use the simplified form of P6: `(~J & ~L) -> T`.\nThis means if KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous.\n\nWe also have `T -> L` (P5) and `L -> J` (P4).\nThis gives us a chain: `T -> L -> J`.\n\nConsider the case where KiKi is NOT terricolous (`~T`).\nIf `~T` is true, does it contradict any premise?\nFrom `T -> L`, if `~T` is true, `L` can be true or false.\nFrom `L -> J`, if `L` is true, then `J` is true. If `L` is false, then `J` can be true or false.\n\nLet's try to find a counterexample where `~Terricolous(KiKi)` is true, but all premises hold.\n\nLet `KiKi` be something that `Jumps`, but `Does Not Have Legs`, and is `Not Terricolous`.\nIs this consistent with the premises?\n`T` = False\n`L` = False\n`J` = True\n\nCheck premises:\n1. `Barks(x) -> ~Likes(Jane, x)` (Not relevant to KiKi's properties T, L, J)\n2. `Dog(x) -> (Animal(x) & Barks(x))` (Not relevant)\n3. `Jumps(x) -> Likes(Jane, x)` (J -> Likes(Jane, KiKi)). Since J is True, Likes(Jane, KiKi) must be True. Consistent.\n4. `HasLegs(x) -> Jumps(x)` (L -> J). False -> True. This is True. Consistent.\n5. `Terricolous(x) -> HasLegs(x)` (T -> L). False -> False. This is True. Consistent.\n6. `(~J & ~L) -> (T | L)`\n   Substitute values: `(~True & ~False) -> (False | False)`\n   `(False & True) -> False`\n   `False -> False`. This is True. Consistent.\n\nSo, we found a scenario where `Terricolous(KiKi)` is false, and all premises are true.\nTherefore, `Terricolous(KiKi)` does not logically follow from the premises.\n\nThe conclusion is not necessarily true.\n\nLet's double-check the interpretation of premise 6.\n`If KiKi neither jumps nor has legs, then KiKi is terricolous or has legs.`\nThis is `(~J(KiKi) AND ~L(KiKi)) IMPLIES (T(KiKi) OR L(KiKi))`.\nLet `P = ~J(KiKi)`, `Q = ~L(KiKi)`, `R = T(KiKi)`, `S = L(KiKi)`.\nSo, `(P AND Q) IMPLIES (R OR S)`.\nWe know `Q` is `~S`.\nSo, `(P AND ~S) IMPLIES (R OR S)`.\n\nIf `S` is true (`L(KiKi)` is true):\nThe left side `(P AND ~S)` is `(P AND False)`, which is `False`.\n`False IMPLIES (R OR S)` is always `True`. So the premise holds.\n\nIf `S` is false (`L(KiKi)` is false):\nThe left side `(P AND ~S)` is `(P AND True)`, which is `P`.\nThe right side `(R OR S)` is `(R OR False)`, which is `R`.\nSo, in this case, the premise simplifies to `P IMPLIES R`, which is `~J(KiKi) IMPLIES T(KiKi)`.\n\nSo, premise 6 effectively states: `If KiKi does not have legs, then if KiKi does not jump, KiKi is terricolous.`\nThis is `~L -> (~J -> T)`.\nWhich is `~L -> (J | T)`.\nWhich is `L | J | T`.\n\nWe have the following implications:\n(P5) `T -> L` (equivalent to `~T | L`)\n(P4) `L -> J` (equivalent to `~L | J`)\n\nFrom `T -> L` and `L -> J`, we can derive `T -> J`. (equivalent to `~T | J`)\n\nNow, we need to check if `T` (Terricolous(KiKi)) can be derived from:\n1. `L | J | T`\n2. `~T | L`\n3. `~L | J`\n\nLet's try to prove `T` by contradiction. Assume `~T`.\nFrom (2) `~T | L`, if `~T` is true, then `L` must be true. (This is wrong. If `~T` is true, then `L` *can be* true, but it doesn't *have to be* true. For `~T | L` to be true when `~T` is true, it is already satisfied. It doesn't force `L` to be true.)\nThis is a common mistake. `A -> B` means `~A \\/ B`. If `~A` is true, `~A \\/ B` is true regardless of `B`. It doesn't force `B` to be true.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the assumption `~T`.\nIf `~T` is true:\nFrom `T -> L` (P5), we know nothing about `L`. `L` could be true or false.\nFrom `L -> J` (P4), we know nothing about `J` if `L` is false. If `L` is true, then `J` must be true.\n\nConsider the logical conjunction of the relevant premises:\n`(~T | L) & (~L | J) & (L | J | T)`\n\nLet's try to set `T` to False and see if we can find a consistent assignment for `L` and `J`.\nAssume `T = False`.\n\nThen the premises become:\n1. `(~False | L)` which is `(True | L)`, which is always `True`. (So `~T | L` gives no information about `L` if `T` is false, which is correct).\n2. `(~L | J)`\n3. `(L | J | False)` which is `(L | J)`\n\nSo, if `T = False`, we need `(~L | J)` and `(L | J)` to be true.\n`(~L | J)` means `L -> J`.\n`(L | J)` means that at least one of `L` or `J` must be true.\n\nCan we have `T = False` and satisfy `(L -> J)` and `(L | J)`?\nYes.\nExample:\nLet `L = True`, `J = True`.\nThen `T = False, L = True, J = True`.\nCheck:\n`T -> L`: `False -> True` (True)\n`L -> J`: `True -> True` (True)\n`L | J | T`: `True | True | False` (True)\n\nThis assignment `T=False, L=True, J=True` satisfies all relevant premises.\nSince we found a scenario where `T` is false and all premises are true, the conclusion `T` does not necessarily follow.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is Uncertain.\n\nThe first step-by-step reasoning in the example provided for the first problem was correct:\n\"If it is paper, then from premise 3, a worksheet is woodware, and from premise 2, a worksheet is dispensable. If it is environment-friendly, we know it is good from premise 5, but we know nothing about whether it is dispensable. Therefore, we don't know if a worksheet is dispensible or not, so the statement is uncertain.\"\n\nMy reasoning here is similar. I found a model where the conclusion is false while all premises are true.\n\nFinal check:\nRelevant Premises:\nP4: `HasLegs(x) -> Jumps(x)` (L -> J)\nP5: `Terricolous(x) -> HasLegs(x)` (T -> L)\nP6: `(~J(KiKi) & ~L(KiKi)) -> (T(KiKi) | L(KiKi))` which simplifies to `L | J | T`\n\nConclusion: `T(KiKi)`\n\nAssume `~T`.\nWe need to check if `L | J | T` is satisfied. Since `T` is `False`, this becomes `L | J`.\nWe need to check if `~T | L` is satisfied. Since `T` is `False`, this becomes `True | L`, which is `True`. This premise is always satisfied if `T` is `False`.\nWe need to check if `~L | J` is satisfied.\n\nSo, if `~T` is true, the premises reduce to `L | J` and `~L | J`.\n`L | J` means `J` is true OR `L` is true.\n`~L | J` means `J` is true OR `L` is false (i.e., `L -> J`).\n\nIf `J` is true, then `L | J` is true, and `~L | J` is true. So `T=False, J=True` is consistent. `L` can be true or false.\nExample: `T=False, J=True, L=False`.\nP4: `L -> J` (False -> True) = True.\nP5: `T -> L` (False -> False) = True.\nP6: `L | J | T` (False | True | False) = True.\nAll relevant premises hold. Conclusion `T` is false.\n\nThis confirms the conclusion is Uncertain.\n\nThe premises about dogs, barking, Jane's likes/dislikes, and good/bad things are distractors as they don't involve KiKi's properties (terricolous, jumps, has legs).\n\n```\nLet T be Terricolous(KiKi)\nLet L be HasLegs(KiKi)\nLet J be Jumps(KiKi)\n\nThe relevant premises are:\nP4: L -> J\nP5: T -> L\nP6: (~J & ~L) -> (T | L)\n\nFrom P5 and P4, we can deduce:\nT -> L -> J, so T -> J.\n\nLet's simplify P6.\nThe expression `(~J & ~L) -> (T | L)` can be analyzed:\nCase 1: L is True.\n  Then ~L is False.\n  The antecedent `(~J & ~L)` becomes `(~J & False)`, which is `False`.\n  An implication with a false antecedent is always true. So, P6 holds if L is True.\nCase 2: L is False.\n  Then ~L is True.\n  The antecedent `(~J & ~L)` becomes `(~J & True)`, which is `~J`.\n  The consequent `(T | L)` becomes `(T | False)`, which is `T`.\n  So, if L is False, P6 simplifies to `~J -> T`.\n\nCombining these, P6 is equivalent to `L OR (~J -> T)`.\nUsing the equivalence `A -> B` is `~A OR B`, we have `~J -> T` is `J OR T`.\nSo P6 is equivalent to `L OR J OR T`.\n\nNow we have the following relevant premises in their simplified form:\n1. P4: L -> J (equivalent to ~L OR J)\n2. P5: T -> L (equivalent to ~T OR L)\n3. P6: L OR J OR T\n\nWe want to determine if the conclusion T necessarily follows.\nLet's assume the conclusion T is False (`~T`) and see if we can maintain consistency with the premises.\n\nIf `~T` is True:\nP5 (`~T OR L`) becomes `True OR L`, which is `True`. This premise is satisfied regardless of L's truth value when T is False. It gives no information about L.\nP6 (`L OR J OR T`) becomes `L OR J OR False`, which simplifies to `L OR J`.\n\nSo, if `T` is False, the remaining effective constraints are:\n(a) `~L OR J` (from P4)\n(b) `L OR J` (from P6)\n\nWe need to find if there exist truth values for L and J such that `~L OR J` and `L OR J` are both true, while `T` is false.\n\nLet's test possible values for L and J:\n- If L is True:\n  (a) `~True OR J` becomes `False OR J`, which is `J`. So J must be True.\n  (b) `True OR J` is `True`. (Always satisfied if L is true).\n  So, if L is True, then J must be True.\n  Example consistent assignment: `T = False, L = True, J = True`.\n  Let's verify this assignment against the original premises:\n  P4: `L -> J` (True -> True) = True. (Holds)\n  P5: `T -> L` (False -> True) = True. (Holds)\n  P6: `(~J & ~L) -> (T | L)` becomes `(~True & ~True) -> (False | True)` which is `(False & False) -> True` which is `False -> True`. (Holds)\n  Since we found a consistent assignment where `T` is False, the conclusion `T` does not necessarily follow.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is Uncertain.\n\nThe premises 1, 2, 3 about dogs, barking, and Jane's likes/dislikes are irrelevant to the conclusion about KiKi's terricolous status, legs, and jumping.\n```"], "answers": ["Uncertain"], "reference": "Uncertain", "time_total": 24.686041116714478, "time_llm": 24.68497347831726, "prompt_length": 1640}

This means `A` is false and `B` is false.\nIn this case, the consequent `(C v B)` must be true.

If `B` is false, then `C v B` simplifies to `C`.\nSo the premise is `(~A ^ ~B) -> C`.\nNow, let's consider the possibilities for `B` (HasLegs(KiKi)).\nCase 1: `HasLegs(KiKi)` is True.\nThen `~HasLegs(KiKi)` is False.\nThe antecedent `(~Jumps(KiKi) ^ ~HasLegs(KiKi))` is False.\nAn implication with a false antecedent is always True, regardless of the consequent.

So `Dog(KiKi)` implies `Barks(KiKi)`.\nSo the conclusion `Barks(KiKi) ^ Dog(KiKi)` can be simplified to `Dog(KiKi)` (because if KiKi is a dog, it necessarily barks).\n\nFrom (1) `Barks(x) -> ~Likes(Jane, x)`\n\nSo, if KiKi barks, Jane does not like KiKi.\nIf KiKi is a dog, then KiKi barks (from 2), and thus Jane does not like KiKi (from 1).\n\nThe premises provide a chain of implications:\n`Terricolous(KiKi) -> HasLegs(KiKi) -> Jumps(KiKi) -> Likes(Jane, KiKi)`\n\nNow let's consider the information from premise 6.\n`(~Jumps(KiKi) ^ ~HasLegs(KiKi)) -> (Terricolous(KiKi) v HasLegs(KiKi))`\n\nLet's assume the conclusion `Barks(KiKi) ^ Dog(KiKi)` is true.\nIf `Dog(KiKi)` is true, then `Barks(KiKi)` is true (from 2).\nIf `Barks(KiKi)` is true, then `~Likes(Jane, KiKi)` is true (from 1).\n\nIf `~Likes(Jane, KiKi)` is true, then `Jumps(KiKi)` must be false (from the contrapositive of 3: `~Likes(Jane, x) -> ~Jumps(x)`).\nSo, if the conclusion is true, then `Jumps(KiKi)` is false.\n\nIf `Jumps(KiKi)` is false, then `HasLegs(KiKi)` must be false (from the contrapositive of 4: `~Jumps(x) -> ~HasLegs(x)`).\nSo, if the conclusion is true, then `HasLegs(KiKi)` is false.\n\nIf `HasLegs(KiKi)` is false, then `Terricolous(KiKi)` must be false (from the contrapositive of 5: `~HasLegs(x) -> ~Terricolous(x)`).\nSo, if the conclusion is true, then `Terricolous(KiKi)` is false.\n\nSo, if `Barks(KiKi) ^ Dog(KiKi)` is true, it implies:\n`Jumps(KiKi)` is false (`~Jumps(KiKi)`)\n`HasLegs(KiKi)` is false (`~HasLegs(KiKi)`)\n`Terricolous(KiKi)` is false (`~Terricolous(KiKi)`)\n\nNow let's substitute these findings into premise 6:\n`(~Jumps(KiKi) ^ ~HasLegs(KiKi)) -> (Terricolous(KiKi) v HasLegs(KiKi))`\n` (True ^ True) -> (False v False)`\n` True -> False`\n\nThis leads to a contradiction. If the conclusion is true, then premise 6 becomes `True -> False`, which is false.\nThis means that the conclusion cannot be true if all premises are true.\nTherefore, the conclusion must be false.\n\nLet's double-check the interpretation of premise 6.\n`(~Jumps(KiKi) ^ ~HasLegs(KiKi)) -> (Terricolous(KiKi) v HasLegs(KiKi))`\nThis statement is equivalent to `~( ~Jumps(KiKi) ^ ~HasLegs(KiKi) ) v (Terricolous(KiKi) v HasLegs(KiKi))`\n` (Jumps(KiKi) v HasLegs(KiKi)) v (Terricolous(KiKi) v HasLegs(KiKi))`\n` Jumps(KiKi) v HasLegs(KiKi) v Terricolous(KiKi)` (since `HasLegs(KiKi)` is repeated)\n\nSo, premise 6 simplifies to `Jumps(KiKi) v HasLegs(KiKi) v Terricolous(KiKi)`.\nThis means at least one of these must be true for KiKi.\n\nNow let's re-evaluate the implications of the conclusion being true:\nIf `Barks(KiKi) ^ Dog(KiKi)` is true, then:\n1.  From (2), `Dog(KiKi)` implies `Barks(KiKi)`. (So just `Dog(KiKi)` is enough to start)\n2.  From (1), `Barks(KiKi)` implies `~Likes(Jane, KiKi)`.\n3.  From (3) (`Jumps(x) -> Likes(Jane, x)`), the contrapositive is `~Likes(Jane, x) -> ~Jumps(x)`. So `~Likes(Jane, KiKi)` implies `~Jumps(KiKi)`.\n4.  From (4) (`HasLegs(x) -> Jumps(x)`), the contrapositive is `~Jumps(x) -> ~HasLegs(x)`. So `~Jumps(KiKi)` implies `~HasLegs(KiKi)`.\n5.  From (5) (`Terricolous(x) -> HasLegs(x)`), the contrapositive is `~HasLegs(x) -> ~Terricolous(x)`. So `~HasLegs(KiKi)` implies `~Terricolous(KiKi)`.\n\nSo, if `Dog(KiKi)` (and thus `Barks(KiKi)`) is true, then it logically follows that:\n`~Jumps(KiKi)`\n`~HasLegs(KiKi)`\n`~Terricolous(KiKi)`\n\nThis means that `Jumps(KiKi)` is false, `HasLegs(KiKi)` is false, and `Terricolous(KiKi)` is false.\n\nHowever, premise 6, simplified, states `Jumps(KiKi) v HasLegs(KiKi) v Terricolous(KiKi)` must be true.\nIf the conclusion is true, then all three parts of this disjunction are false.\n`False v False v False` which evaluates to `False`.\n\nThis contradicts premise 6, which must be true.\nTherefore, the assumption that the conclusion is true leads to a contradiction with the premises.\nThis means the conclusion must be false.\n\nThe simplification of premise 6 is key.\n`P6: (~J ^ ~H) -> (T v H)`\nThis is equivalent to `~( ~J ^ ~H ) v (T v H)`\n` (J v H) v (T v H)`\n` J v H v T` (by idempotence of v)\n\nSo, premise 6 essentially states that KiKi either jumps, has legs, or is terricolous.\nFrom the conclusion `KiKi barks and is a dog`, we derive:\n1. KiKi is a dog (from conclusion)\n2. KiKi barks (from 2)\n3. Jane does not like KiKi (from 1)\n4. KiKi does not jump (contrapositive of 3, using 3)\n5. KiKi does not have legs (contrapositive of 4, using 4)\n6. KiKi is not terricolous (contrapositive of 5, using 5)\n\nSteps 4, 5, and 6 mean that `~Jumps(KiKi)`, `~HasLegs(KiKi)`, and `~Terricolous(KiKi)` are all true.\nIf these are all true, then the disjunction `Jumps(KiKi) v HasLegs(KiKi) v Terricolous(KiKi)` must be false.\nBut this disjunction is equivalent to premise 6, which must be true.\nSince the premises cannot be both true and false simultaneously, the initial assumption (that the conclusion is true) must be false.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is false.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{False}$"], "answers": ["False"], "reference": "False", "time_total": 16.375693798065186, "time_llm": 16.374974012374878, "prompt_length": 1644}

This means `S` is the negation of `Q` (`S = ~Q`).\n\nSubstitute `S` with `~Q` in Premise 6:\n`(P ^ Q) -> (R v ~Q)`\n\nLet's analyze the consequent `(R v ~Q)`. This is equivalent to `~Q v R`.\nSo, Premise 6 is `(P ^ Q) -> (~Q v R)`\n\nThis statement `(P ^ Q) -> (~Q v R)` is a tautology.\nTo see this, consider the truth table or logical equivalences:\n`~(P ^ Q) v (~Q v R)` (Implication definition)\n`(~P v ~Q) v (~Q v R)` (De Morgan's Law)\n`~P v (~Q v ~Q) v R` (Associativity)\n`~P v ~Q v R` (Idempotence)\n\nThis `~P v ~Q v R` is equivalent to `~(P ^ Q) v R`.\nNow, let's substitute back the original predicates:\n`~(~Jumps(KiKi) ^ ~HasLegs(KiKi)) v Terricolous(KiKi)`\nThis is `(Jumps(KiKi) v HasLegs(KiKi)) v Terricolous(KiKi)`.\n\nSo, Premise 6 essentially states that `Jumps(KiKi) v HasLegs(KiKi) v Terricolous(KiKi)` must be true.\n\nNow let's use the other premises:\nFrom Premise 5: `Terricolous(KiKi) -> HasLegs(KiKi)`\nFrom Premise 4: `HasLegs(KiKi) -> Jumps(KiKi)`\n\nCombining these, we get: `Terricolous(KiKi) -> HasLegs(KiKi) -> Jumps(KiKi)`.\nThis means if `Terricolous(KiKi)` is true, then `HasLegs(KiKi)` is true, and `Jumps(KiKi)` is true.\n\nNow, consider the implication of Premise 6 which simplifies to `Jumps(KiKi) v HasLegs(KiKi) v Terricolous(KiKi)`.\nBecause of the chain `Terricolous -> HasLegs -> Jumps`, if `Terricolous(KiKi)` is true, then `Jumps(KiKi)` is true. If `HasLegs(KiKi)` is true, then `Jumps(KiKi)` is true.\nTherefore, the disjunction `Jumps(KiKi) v HasLegs(KiKi) v Terricolous(KiKi)` is logically equivalent to just `Jumps(KiKi)`.\nWhy? If `Jumps(KiKi)` is true, the disjunction is true. If `Jumps(KiKi)` is false, then `HasLegs(KiKi)` must be false (from P4) and `Terricolous(KiKi)` must be false (from P5). So if `Jumps(KiKi)` is false, the entire disjunction is false.\nThus, Premise 6 simplifies to `Jumps(KiKi)`.\n\nSo, we can deduce: `Jumps(KiKi)`.\n\nNow let's use this deduction:\nWe know `Jumps(KiKi)`.\nFrom Premise 3: `Jumps(KiKi) -> Likes(Jane, KiKi)`.\nSo, `Likes(Jane, KiKi)`.\n\nThe conclusion is `~Barks(KiKi) ^ ~Dog(KiKi)`.\n\nLet's see if we can prove `~Barks(KiKi)`:\nFrom Premise 1: `Barks(KiKi) -> ~Likes(Jane, KiKi)`.\nWe deduced `Likes(Jane, KiKi)`.\nTherefore, by modus tollens on Premise 1, `~Barks(KiKi)` must be true.\n\nNow, let's see if we can prove `~Dog(KiKi)`:\nFrom Premise 2: `Dog(KiKi) -> (Animal(KiKi) ^ Barks(KiKi))`.\nWe have already deduced `~Barks(KiKi)`.\nIf `Dog(KiKi)` were true, then `Barks(KiKi)` would have to be true (from P2).\nSince `Barks(KiKi)` is false, `Dog(KiKi)` must be false.\n\nBoth parts of the conclusion (`~Barks(KiKi)` and `~Dog(KiKi)`) follow from the premises.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is true.\n\nThe key step is realizing that premise 6 is a tautology which simplifies significantly given premises 4 and 5.\nP6: `(~Jumps(KiKi) ^ ~HasLegs(KiKi)) -> (Terricolous(KiKi) v HasLegs(KiKi))`\nLet's consider the contrapositive of P6:\n`~(Terricolous(KiKi) v HasLegs(KiKi)) -> ~(~Jumps(KiKi) ^ ~HasLegs(KiKi))`\n`(~Terricolous(KiKi) ^ ~HasLegs(KiKi)) -> (Jumps(KiKi) v HasLegs(KiKi))`\n\nAlternatively, as shown above, P6 simplifies to `Jumps(KiKi) v HasLegs(KiKi) v Terricolous(KiKi)`.\nGiven `Terricolous -> HasLegs -> Jumps`:\nIf `Terricolous(KiKi)` is true, then `HasLegs(KiKi)` is true, and `Jumps(KiKi)` is true. So the disjunction is true.\nIf `HasLegs(KiKi)` is true (and `Terricolous(KiKi)` is false), then `Jumps(KiKi)` is true. So the disjunction is true.\nIf `Jumps(KiKi)` is true (and `HasLegs(KiKi)` and `Terricolous(KiKi)` are false), then the disjunction is true.\nIf `Jumps(KiKi)` is false, then `HasLegs(KiKi)` must be false (from P4), and `Terricolous(KiKi)` must be false (from P5). In this case, the entire disjunction `Jumps(KiKi) v HasLegs(KiKi) v Terricolous(KiKi)` would be false.\nTherefore, for the disjunction to be true, `Jumps(KiKi)` must be true. So `Jumps(KiKi)` is a necessary and sufficient condition for the disjunction to be true.\nThus, P6 implies `Jumps(KiKi)`.\n\nFrom `Jumps(KiKi)`:\n1. From P3: `Jumps(KiKi) -> Likes(Jane, KiKi)`. So `Likes(Jane, KiKi)`.\n2. From P1: `Barks(KiKi) -> ~Likes(Jane, KiKi)`. Since `Likes(Jane, KiKi)` is true, `~Likes(Jane, KiKi)` is false. By modus tollens, `Barks(KiKi)` must be false. So `~Barks(KiKi)`.\n3. From P2: `Dog(KiKi) -> (Animal(KiKi) ^ Barks(KiKi))`. Since `~Barks(KiKi)` is true, `Barks(KiKi)` is false. The consequent `(Animal(KiKi) ^ Barks(KiKi))` is false.

We want to evaluate if a worksheet is not dispensable. From premise 6, we know that a worksheet is either paper or is environment-friendly. If it is paper, then from premise 3, a worksheet is woodware, and from premise 2, a worksheet is dispensable. If it is environment-friendly, we know it is good from premise 5, but we know nothing about whether it is dispensable. Therefore, we don't know if a worksheet is dispensible or not, so the statement is uncertain.\nANSWER:\tUncertain\n</EVALUATE>\n\n---\n\n<PREMISES>\nAilton Silva, born in 1995, is commonly known as Ailton.\nAilton is a football player who was loaned out to Braga.\nAilton Silva is a Brazillian footballer who plays for Nautico.\nNautico is a football club along with Braga.\nFluminense is a football club.\n</PREMISES>\n<CONCLUSION>\nAilton Silva was loaned out to a football club.\n</CONCLUSION>\n<EVALUATE>\n", "raw_generations": ["Let's break this down.\n\n1.  **\"Ailton is a football player who was loaned out to Braga.\"** (Premise 2)\n2.  **\"Nautico is a football club along with Braga.\"** (Premise 4)\n\nFrom these two premises, we know that Braga is a football club. Since Ailton was loaned out to Braga, it logically follows that Ailton was loaned out to a football club.\n\nThe other premises (Ailton's birth year, common name, nationality, current club Fluminense being a club) are all consistent with this conclusion but not strictly necessary to derive it.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is true.\n\nANSWER: True"], "answers": ["True"], "reference": "Uncertain", "time_total": 2.4198343753814697, "time_llm": 2.419529914855957, "prompt_length": 1641}
