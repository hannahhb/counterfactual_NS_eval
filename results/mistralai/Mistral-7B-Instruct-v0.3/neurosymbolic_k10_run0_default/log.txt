TEXT: No choral conductor specialized in the performance of Renaissance.
FOL: -(exists x. (ChoralConductor(x) & SpecializesIn(x, PerformanceOf(RenaissanceMusic))))

In this case, the conclusion does not follow from the premises. The premises do not specify that Miroslav Venhoda was the only choral conductor or that no other choral conductor specialized in Renaissance music. Therefore, it is not possible to conclude that no choral conductor specialized in the performance of Renaissance based on the given premises.
Processed: False

TEXT: Miroslav Venhoda was a Czech choral conductor who specialized in the performance of Renaissance and Baroque music.
FOL: Conductor(MiroslavVenhoda) & Czech(MiroslavVenhoda) & SpecializedIn(MiroslavVenhoda, PerformanceOfRenaissance) & SpecializedIn(MiroslavVenhoda, PerformanceOfBaroqueMusic)

TEXT: No choral conductor specialized in the performance of Renaissance.
FOL: -exists x. (Conductor(x) & SpecializesIn(x, PerformanceOf(Renaissance)Music))

This conclusion does not follow from the premises because the premises do not state or imply that no choral conductor specialized in the performance of Renaissance. The conclusion seems to be incorrect.

TEXT: No choral conductor specialized in the performance of Renaissance.
FOL: -(exists x. (ChoralConductor(x) & SpecializedIn(x, PerformanceOf(RenaissanceMusic))))

In this case, the conclusion does not follow from the premises. The conclusion incorrectly assumes that if a choral conductor specializes in Baroque music, they do not specialize in Renaissance music. However, the premises do not provide information about whether a choral conductor can specialize in more than one type of music.
Processed: False

As the conclusion does not follow from the premises, the answer is "Inconclusive".

Therefore, it cannot be inferred that no choral conductor specialized in the performance of Renaissance music.
Processed: False

Generation 6:
TEXT: Miroslav Venhoda was a Czech choral conductor who specialized in the performance of Renaissance and Baroque music.
FOL: ChoralConductor(MiroslavVenhoda) & SpecializesIn(MiroslavVenhoda, PerformanceOf(Renaissance & BaroqueMusic))
TEXT: Any choral conductor is a musician.

TEXT: No choral conductor specialized in the performance of Renaissance.
FOL: -exists x. (ChoralConductor(x) & SpecializesIn(x, PerformanceOf(Renaissance)))

In this case, the premises do not provide enough information to conclude whether Miroslav Venhoda specialized in the performance of Renaissance or not. The conclusion is incorrect because Miroslav Venhoda did indeed specialize in the performance of Renaissance and Baroque music according to the given premises.
Processed: Error

Generation 7:
TEXT: Miroslav Venhoda was a Czech choral conductor who specialized in the performance of Renaissance and Baroque music.
FOL: ChoralConductor(MiroslavVenhoda) & SpecializedIn(MiroslavVenhoda, PerformanceOf(RenaissanceMusic)) & SpecializedIn(MiroslavVenhoda, PerformanceOf(BaroqueMusic))

TEXT: No choral conductor specialized in the performance of Renaissance.
FOL: -exists x. (ChoralConductor(x) & SpecializedIn(x, PerformanceOf(RenaissanceMusic)))

This problem does not have a conclusion to evaluate since the conclusion provided is not related to the premises. The conclusion seems to be incorrect as Miroslav Venhoda, a choral conductor, did indeed specialize in the performance of Renaissance music according to the premises.
Processed: False

Generation 8:
TEXT: Miroslav Venhoda was a Czech choral conductor who specialized in the performance of Renaissance and Baroque music.
FOL: ChoralConductor(MiroslavVenhoda) & SpecializesIn(MiroslavVenhoda, PerformanceOf(RenaissanceMusic)) & SpecializesIn(MiroslavVenhoda, PerformanceOf(BaroqueMusic))

TEXT: No choral conductor specialized in the performance of Renaissance.
FOL: -(exists x. (ChoralConductor(x) & Specializes(x, PerformanceOf(Renaissance, Music))))

In this case, the conclusion does not follow from the premises. The premises only state that Miroslav Venhoda specialized in the performance of both Renaissance and Baroque music, but they do not provide information about other choral conductors. Therefore, it is not valid to conclude that no choral conductor specialized in the performance of Renaissance.
Processed: False

Generation 10:

In the given conclusion, it seems there is a mistake. The conclusion does not follow from the given premises. The premises only state that Miroslav Venhoda specialized in the performance of Renaissance and Baroque music, but they do not provide information about other choral conductors. Therefore, we cannot conclude that no choral conductor specialized in the performance of Renaissance.

FOL: all x. (Reptile(x) -> -HasFur(x))
TEXT: All snakes are reptiles.
FOL: all x. (Snake(x) -> Reptile(x))
TEXT: Some snake has fur.
FOL: exists x. (Snake(x) & HasFur(x))

This is a classical non-sequitur, where the conclusion does not follow from the premises. The premises state that no reptile has fur and all snakes are reptiles, but there is no information about whether some snakes have fur or not. Therefore, the conclusion is false.
Processed: False

Generation 2:
TEXT: No reptile has fur.
FOL: all x. (Reptile(x) -> -HasFur(x))
TEXT: All snakes are reptiles.
FOL: all x. (Snake(x) -> Reptile(x))
TEXT: Some snake has fur.
FOL: exists x. (Snake(x) & HasFur(x))

In this case, the conclusion does not follow from the premises. The premises state that no reptile has fur and all snakes are reptiles, which implies that no snake has fur. Therefore, the conclusion that some snake has fur is false.
Processed: False

Generation 3:
TEXT: No reptile has fur.
FOL: all x. (Reptile(x) -> -Fur(x))
TEXT: All snakes are reptiles.
FOL: all x. (Snake(x) -> Reptile(x))
TEXT: Some snake has fur.
FOL: exists x. (Snake(x) & Fur(x))

The conclusion does not follow from the premises. There is no information provided about snakes having fur or not, and the premise states that no reptile has fur. Therefore, it cannot be inferred that some snake has fur.
Processed: False

Generation 4:
TEXT: No reptile has fur.
FOL: all x. (Reptile(x) -> -HasFur(x))

TEXT: All snakes are reptiles.
FOL: all x. (Snake(x) -> Reptile(x))

TEXT: Some snake has fur.
FOL: exists x. (Snake(x) & HasFur(x))

The conclusion does not follow from the premises since all snakes are reptiles and reptiles do not have fur. Therefore, no snake has fur.
Processed: False

Generation 5:
TEXT: No reptile has fur.
FOL: all x. (Reptile(x) -> -HasFur(x))
TEXT: All snakes are reptiles.
FOL: all x. (Snake(x) -> Reptile(x))
TEXT: Some snake has fur.
FOL: exists x. (Snake(x) & HasFur(x))

In the given FOL expressions, the premises state that no reptile has fur and all snakes are reptiles. The conclusion, however, asserts that some snake has fur, which contradicts the premises. Therefore, the conclusion does not follow from the premises.
Processed: False

Generation 6:
TEXT: No reptile has fur.
FOL: all x. (Reptile(x) -> -HasFur(x))
TEXT: All snakes are reptiles.
FOL: all x. (Snake(x) -> Reptile(x))
TEXT: Some snake has fur.
FOL: exists x. (Snake(x) & HasFur(x))

The conclusion does not follow from the premises because all the premises state is that no reptiles have fur and all snakes are reptiles. They do not provide any information about whether some snakes have fur.

TEXT: No reptile has fur.
FOL: all x. (Reptile(x) -> -HasFur(x))
TEXT: All snakes are reptiles.
FOL: all x. (Snake(x) -> Reptile(x))
TEXT: Some snake has fur.
FOL: exists x. (Snake(x) & HasFur(x))

The conclusion does not follow from the premises. A snake is a reptile, and all reptiles do not have fur. Therefore, it cannot be inferred that some snake has fur.
Processed: False

TEXT: No reptile has fur.
FOL: all x. (Reptile(x) -> -HasFur(x))
TEXT: All snakes are reptiles.
FOL: all x. (Snake(x) -> Reptile(x))
TEXT: Some snake has fur.
FOL: exists x. (Snake(x) & HasFur(x))

The conclusion does not follow from the premises because the premises state that no reptile has fur, and since all snakes are reptiles, it can be inferred that no snake has fur. Therefore, it is not possible for some snake to have fur. The conclusion is false given the premises.
Processed: False

Generation 10:
TEXT: No reptile has fur.
FOL: all x. (Reptile(x) -> -HasFur(x))
TEXT: All snakes are reptiles.
FOL: all x. (Snake(x) -> Reptile(x))
TEXT: Some snake has fur.

To prove this conclusion, we need to show that the discoverer of Ambiortus, Yevgeny Kurochkin, lived in the same place as Ambiortus, which is Mongolia.

Here are the premises translated into FOL expressions:

TEXT: Ambiortus is a prehistoric bird genus.
FOL: PrehistoricBirdGenus(Ambiortus)

TEXT: Ambiortus Dementjevi is the only known species of Ambiortus.
FOL: Species(AmbiortusDementjevi) & OnlyKnownSpecies(AmbiortusDementjevi, Ambiortus)

TEXT: Mongolia was where Ambiortus Dementjevi lived.

TEXT: Yevgeny Kurochkin was the discoverer of Ambiortus.
FOL: Discoverer(YevgenyKurochkin, Ambiortus)
Processed: Uncertain

Generation 7:
TEXT: Yevgeny Kurochkin lived in Mongolia.
FOL: Lives(YevgenyKurochkin, Mongolia)

The given premises do not directly imply that Yevgeny Kurochkin lived in Mongolia. However, since Ambiortus Dementjevi lived in Mongolia and Yevgeny Kurochkin was the discoverer of Ambiortus, it is reasonable to assume that Yevgeny Kurochkin might have visited or lived in Mongolia during the discovery process. But based on the given premises, this is not a definitive conclusion. Therefore, the theorem prover Prover9 might not be able to prove this conclusion from the given premises.

For a theorem prover to prove this conclusion, additional premises like "Discoverers of a species often live near the species' habitat" or "Yevgeny Kurochkin lived in Mongolia for a significant period during the discovery of Ambiortus" might be needed.

Generation 8:
TEXT: Yevgeny Kurochkin lived in Mongolia.

TEXT: Yevgeny Kurochkin was the discoverer of Ambiortus.
FOL: Discovered(YevgenyKurochkin, Ambiortus)

Since we don't have any explicit information about where Yevgeny Kurochkin lived, we cannot directly deduce the conclusion from the given premises. However, if we assume that Yevgeny Kurochkin lived where Ambiortus Dementjevi lived (as it's reasonable to assume that the discoverer of a species might have been in the same place as the species itself), we can derive the conclusion:

LivedIn(YevgenyKurochkin, Mongolia) ⊢ LivedIn(YevgenyKurochkin, Mongolia) (assuming YevgenyKurochkin lived where Ambiortus Dementjevi lived)

This shows that, given our assumption, the conclusion follows from the premises. However, without additional information about Yevgeny Kurochkin, we cannot definitively prove the conclusion from the premises alone.
Processed: Uncertain

Generation 9:
TEXT: Yevgeny Kurochkin lived in Mongolia.
FOL: LivesIn(YevgenyKurochkin, Mongolia)

To prove this conclusion, we need to show that Yevgeny Kurochkin discovered Ambiortus, which lived in Mongolia. Here are the FOL expressions for the given premises:

TEXT: Ambiortus is a prehistoric bird genus.
FOL: PrehistoricBirdGenus(Ambiortus)

TEXT: Ambiortus Dementjevi is the only known species of Ambiortus.
FOL: Species(AmbiortusDementjevi) & SingleSpecies(AmbiortusDementjevi, Ambiortus)

TEXT: Mongolia was where Ambiortus Dementjevi lived.
FOL: LivesIn(AmbiortusDementjevi, Mongolia)

TEXT: Yevgeny Kurochkin was the discoverer of Ambiortus.
FOL: Discoverer(YevgenyKurochkin, Ambiortus)

Now, we can use the given conclusion by substituting Yevgeny Kurochkin for x and Mongolia for y in the following formula:

TEXT: If someone discovers something that lives in a place, then that person lived in that place.
FOL: all x. all y. (Discoverer(x, y) & LivesIn(y, z) -> LivesIn(x, z))

Finally, we can use the Prover9 theorem solver to prove the conclusion:

PROVER9:
(declare-fun LivesIn (Symbol Symbol) Bool)
(declare-fun Discoverer (Symbol Symbol) Bool)
(declare-fun Species (Symbol) Bool)
(declare-fun SingleSpecies (Symbol Symbol) Bool)
(declare-fun PrehistoricBirdGenus (Symbol) Bool)
(assert (PrehistoricBirdGenus Ambiortus))
(assert (Species AmbiortusDementjevi))
(assert (SingleSpecies AmbiortusDementjevi Ambiortus))
(assert (LivesIn AmbiortusDementjevi Mongolia))
(assert (Discoverer YevgenyKurochkin Ambiortus))
(assert (implies (and (Discoverer x y) (LivesIn y z)) (LivesIn x z)))
(find-model)

The result will be a model that assigns true to LivesIn(YevgenyKurochkin, Mongolia), which means the conclusion follows from the premises.

FOL: -DistrictInCity(Guilin, Yangshuo)

TEXT: Xiangshan and Diecai are districts in the same city.
FOL: (DistrictInCity(Guilin, Xiangshan) & DistrictInCity(Guilin, Diecai)) -> SameCity(Xiangshan, Diecai)

(Since we do not have any additional information about the relationship between the districts, we cannot conclude that Xiangshan and Diecai are in the same city based solely on the provided premises.)
Processed: Uncertain

Generation 4:
TEXT: Xiufeng, Xiangshan, Diecai, Qixing are districts in the city of Guilin.
FOL: District(Xiufeng, Guilin) & District(Xiangshan, Guilin) & District(Diecai, Guilin) & District(Qixing, Guilin)

TEXT: Yangshuo is not a district in Guilin.
FOL: -District(Yangshuo, Guilin)

TEXT: Xiangshan and Diecai are districts in the same city.
To express this, we need to first introduce a new predicate `SameCityAs` and then use it to state that Xiangshan and Diecai are in the same city, which is Guilin.
FOL: all x. all y. ((District(x, Guilin) & District(y, Guilin)) -> (SameCityAs(x, y) <=> ((x = Xiangshan) & (y = Diecai)) | ((x = Diecai) & (y = Xiangshan))))

This FOL expression states that two districts x and y are in the same city if and only if they are either Xiangshan and Diecai or Diecai and Xiangshan. This implies that Xiangshan and Diecai are in the same city (Guilin).
Processed: Uncertain

Generation 5:
TEXT: Xiufeng, Xiangshan, Diecai, Qixing are districts in the city of Guilin.
FOL: District(Xiufeng, Guilin) & District(Xiangshan, Guilin) & District(Diecai, Guilin) & District(Qixing, Guilin)

TEXT: Yangshuo is not a district in Guilin.
FOL: -District(Yangshuo, Guilin)

TEXT: Xiangshan and Diecai are districts in the same city.
FOL: InCity(Xiangshan, Guilin) & InCity(Diecai, Guilin) & Xiangshan != Diecai

The conclusion does not follow from the premises as the premises do not provide any information about the relationship between Xiangshan and Diecai being in the same district.
Processed: Uncertain

Generation 6:
TEXT: Xiufeng, Xiangshan, Diecai, Qixing are districts in the city of Guilin.
FOL: DistrictInCity(Guilin, Xiufeng) & DistrictInCity(Guilin, Xiangshan) & DistrictInCity(Guilin, Diecai) & DistrictInCity(Guilin, Qixing)

TEXT: Yangshuo is not a district in Guilin.
FOL: -DistrictInCity(Guilin, Yangshuo)

TEXT: Xiangshan and Diecai are districts in the same city.
FOL: (DistrictInCity(city, Xiangshan) & DistrictInCity(city, Diecai)) -> (city = Guilin)

In order to determine whether the conclusion follows from the premises, we can use the FOL expressions to create a logical proof. However, the provided premises do not directly imply that Xiangshan and Diecai are districts in the same city. Therefore, the conclusion does not follow from the premises.

It would require additional information or assumptions about the relationship between the districts to establish that they are in the same city. For example, if we know that all districts in Guilin are part of the same city, then we could infer that Xiangshan and Diecai are districts in the same city.

FOL: all x. (DistrictInCity(Guilin, x) -> all y. (DistrictInCity(Guilin, y) -> city = Guilin))

Then, we can use the given premises and the additional assumption to prove that Xiangshan and Diecai are districts in the same city:

1. DistrictInCity(Guilin, Xiufeng)
2. DistrictInCity(Guilin, Xiangshan)
3. DistrictInCity(Guilin, Diecai)
4. all x. (DistrictInCity(Guilin, x) -> all y. (DistrictInCity(Guilin, y) -> city = Guilin))
5. DistrictInCity(Guilin, Xiangshan)
6. DistrictInCity(Guilin, Diecai)
7. city = Guilin (from assumption 4 and 5)
8. (DistrictInCity(city, Xiangshan) & DistrictInCity(city, Diecai)) -> (city = Guilin) (from given conclusion)
9. city = Guilin (from step 7)
10. DistrictInCity(Guilin, Xiangshan) (given)
11. DistrictInCity(Guilin, Diecai) (given)
12. city = Guilin (from step 9)
13. (DistrictInCity(Guilin, Xiangshan) & DistrictInCity(Guilin, Diecai)) (from steps 10 and 11)
14. (DistrictInCity(Guilin, Xiangshan) & DistrictInCity(Guilin, Diecai)) -> (city = Guilin) (from step 8)
15. The conclusion follows from the premises.

TEXT: Yangshuo is not a district in Guilin.

TEXT: Xiangshan and Diecai are districts in the same city.
FOL: (DistrictInGuilin(Xiangshan) & DistrictInGuilin(Diecai)) -> SameCity(Xiangshan, Diecai)

Since we don't have any additional information about the relationship between the districts, we can't determine whether the conclusion follows from the premises. The theorem solver would return "unknown" for this case.
Processed: Uncertain

Generation 10:

TEXT: Yangshuo is not a district in Guilin.
FOL: -DistrictInGuilin(Yangshuo)

TEXT: Xiangshan and Diecai are districts in the same city.
FOL: DistrictInSameCity(Xiangshan, Diecai)

Since the premises do not provide any information about the cities that Xiangshan and Diecai are in, it is not possible to determine whether the conclusion follows from the premises. We would need additional information to make a determination.

</CONCLUSION>
<EVALUATE>

Generation 1:
TEXT: All iPhones are electronic.
FOL: all x. (iPhone(x) -> Electronic(x))
TEXT: Some phones are iPhones.
FOL: exists x. (Phone(x) & iPhone(x))
TEXT: No phones are electronic.
FOL: -(exists x. (Phone(x) & Electronic(x)))

This FOL statement is not valid, as it contradicts the premise that some phones are iPhones, which are electronic. Therefore, the conclusion does not follow from the premises.
Processed: False

Generation 2:
TEXT: All iPhones are electronic.
FOL: all x. (iPhone(x) -> Electronic(x))
TEXT: Some phones are iPhones.
FOL: exists x. (Phone(x) & iPhone(x))
TEXT: No phones are electronic.
FOL: -(exists x. (Phone(x) & Electronic(x)))

In this case, the conclusion does not follow from the premises. The premises state that some phones are iPhones and that all iPhones are electronic, but they do not provide information about all phones being electronic. Therefore, the conclusion that no phones are electronic is not supported by the given premises.
Processed: False

Generation 3:
TEXT: All iPhones are electronic.
FOL: all x. (iPhone(x) -> Electronic(x))
TEXT: Some phones are iPhones.
FOL: exists x. (Phone(x) & iPhone(x))
TEXT: No phones are electronic.
FOL: -all x. (Phone(x) -> Electronic(x))

Generation 4:
TEXT: All iPhones are electronic.
FOL: all x. (iPhone(x) -> Electronic(x))
TEXT: Some phones are iPhones.
FOL: exists x. (Phone(x) & iPhone(x))
TEXT: No phones are electronic.
FOL: -(exists x. (Phone(x) & Electronic(x)))

In this case, the conclusion does not follow from the premises. The premises state that some phones are iPhones and all iPhones are electronic, but they do not state that all phones are electronic. Therefore, it is possible for some phones to be electronic (iPhones) and for others not to be electronic (non-iPhone phones). Hence, the conclusion that no phones are electronic is not valid.
Processed: False

Generation 5:
TEXT: All iPhones are electronic.
FOL: all x. (iPhone(x) -> Electronic(x))
TEXT: Some phones are iPhones.
FOL: exists x. (Phone(x) & iPhone(x))
TEXT: No phones are electronic.
FOL: -all x. (Phone(x) -> Electronic(x))

In this case, the conclusion does not follow from the premises. The premises only state that some phones are iPhones and all iPhones are electronic, but they do not say that all phones are electronic. Therefore, it is possible for other phones to exist that are not electronic.
Processed: Uncertain

Generation 6:
TEXT: All iPhones are electronic.
FOL: all x. (iPhone(x) -> Electronic(x))
TEXT: Some phones are iPhones.
FOL: exists x. (Phone(x) & iPhone(x))
TEXT: No phones are electronic.
FOL: -all x. (Phone(x) -> Electronic(x))

In this case, the conclusion does not follow from the premises. The premises only state that some phones are iPhones and all iPhones are electronic, but they do not exclude the possibility that other phones are also electronic. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that no phones are electronic.
Processed: Uncertain

Generation 7:
TEXT: All iPhones are electronic.
FOL: all x. (iPhone(x) -> Electronic(x))
TEXT: Some phones are iPhones.
FOL: exists x. (Phone(x) & iPhone(x))
TEXT: No phones are electronic.

This conclusion does not follow from the given premises. The conclusion implies that all phones are not electronic, but the premises only state that some phones are iPhones and all iPhones are electronic, not that all phones are iPhones.
Processed: False

Generation 8:
TEXT: All iPhones are electronic.
FOL: all x. (iPhone(x) -> Electronic(x))
TEXT: Some phones are iPhones.
FOL: exists x. (Phone(x) & iPhone(x))
TEXT: No phones are electronic.
FOL: -(exists x. (Phone(x) & Electronic(x)))

The conclusion does not follow from the premises. The premises state that some phones are iPhones and that all iPhones are electronic, but they do not state that all phones are electronic. Therefore, it is possible for phones to be electronic without contradicting the premises.
Processed: False

Generation 9:
TEXT: All iPhones are electronic.
FOL: all x. (iPhone(x) -> Electronic(x))
TEXT: Some phones are iPhones.
FOL: exists x. (Phone(x) & iPhone(x))
TEXT: No phones are electronic.

FOL: -(Platypus(Grebe)) & -(Echidna(Grebe))
TEXT: Hyraxes lay eggs.
FOL: EggLaying(Hyrax)

In this case, the conclusion follows from the premises. Hyraxes are mammals (from the fourth premise), and all mammals are animals (from the sixth premise). Since hyraxes are animals, they are either vertebrates or invertebrates (from the seventh premise). Since no mammals are invertebrates (from the third premise), hyraxes must be vertebrates. Furthermore, hyraxes are not platypuses or echidnas (from the second and third premises), and these are the only egg-laying mammals (from the first premise). Therefore, if hyraxes are mammals and not platypuses or echidnas, they must lay eggs. This is consistent with the conclusion.

FOL: LayEggs(Hyrax)

In this problem, we are given information about various types of mammals and their reproductive habits. We are also given information about grebes, a type of bird that lays eggs. The conclusion asks whether hyraxes lay eggs, which are mammals.

From the premises, we know that the only types of mammals that lay eggs are platypuses and echidnas. However, we are told that hyraxes are not platypuses or echidnas. We also know that grebes lay eggs but are not platypuses or echidnas. Since hyraxes are mammals and are not platypuses or echidnas, they cannot lay eggs like platypuses and echidnas. Therefore, it would seem that hyraxes do not lay eggs.

However, it is important to note that the premises do not explicitly state that hyraxes are the only mammals that do not lay eggs. It is possible that there are other mammals that do not lay eggs, and it is also possible that hyraxes are one of those mammals.

Without additional information about the reproductive habits of hyraxes, it is difficult to definitively say whether the conclusion follows from the premises. It is possible that the conclusion is false, but we cannot prove it to be true based on the information given.

In this problem, the conclusion follows from the premises. The premises state that only platypuses and echidnas are mammals that lay eggs, and both platypuses and echidnas are not hyraxes. Since hyraxes are mammals, and hyraxes are not the types of mammals that lay eggs, it can be concluded that hyraxes do not lay eggs. However, the conclusion is a restatement of the information provided in the premises, and it would be more informative to conclude that hyraxes do not lay eggs like platypuses and echidnas.

FOL: exists x. (Develops(ETS, x) & StateWideAssessment(x) & UsedFor(x, AccountabilityTesting))

TEXT: ETS doesn't administer tests internationally.
FOL: -(exists x. (Administers(ETS, x) & InternationalTest(x)))

Since the FOL for the premises and conclusion don't have a contradiction, the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises. The premises only suggest that ETS administers international tests, but they don't rule out the possibility that it also administers tests internationally.
Processed: Uncertain

Generation 2:
TEXT: ETS develops various standardized tests primarily in the United States for K-12 and higher education.
FOL: all x. (Develops(ETS, x) -> (StandardizedTest(x) & In(x, UnitedStates) & (For(x, K12) | For(x, HigherEducation))))
TEXT: ETS administers international tests, including the TOEFL, TOEIC, GRE, and subject tests.
FOL: all x. (Administration(ETS, x) -> (InternationalTest(x) & (TOEFL(x) | TOEIC(x) | GRE(x) | SubjectTest(x))))
TEXT: Many of the assessments ETS develops are associated with entry to the US tertiary and quaternary education institutions.

TEXT: ETS also develops K-12 statewide assessments used for accountability testing in many states.

TEXT: ETS doesn't administer tests internationally.
FOL: all x. (Administration(ETS, x) -> In(x, UnitedStates))

In this case, the conclusion does not follow from the premises. The premises state that ETS develops and administers various tests, some of which are international, and that many of the assessments are associated with entry to US institutions. However, the conclusion states that ETS does not administer tests internationally, which contradicts the information provided in the premises.
Processed: Uncertain

Generation 3:
TEXT: ETS develops various standardized tests primarily in the United States for K-12 and higher education.
FOL: all x. (Develops(ETS, x) -> In(x, UnitedStates) & (For(x, K12) | For(x, HigherEducation)))

TEXT: ETS administers international tests, including the TOEFL, TOEIC, GRE, and subject tests.
FOL: exists x. (Administers(ETS, x) & International(x) & (TOEFL(x) | TOEIC(x) | GRE(x) | SubjectTest(x)))

TEXT: Many of the assessments ETS develops are associated with entry to the US tertiary and quaternary education institutions.
FOL: exists x. (Develops(ETS, x) & AssociatedWith(x, EntryToUSeducationInstitutions))

TEXT: ETS also develops K-12 statewide assessments used for accountability testing in many states.
FOL: exists x. (Develops(ETS, x) & StatewideAssessment(x) & UsedFor(x, AccountabilityTesting))

TEXT: ETS doesn't administer tests internationally.
FOL: exists x. (Develops(ETS, x) & For(x, K12)) & exists x. (Develops(ETS, x) & AssociatedWith(x, EntryToUSeducationInstitutions))

In this case, the conclusion does not follow from the premises. The premises state that ETS develops tests primarily in the United States for K-12 and higher education, administers international tests, and develops K-12 statewide assessments used for accountability testing. However, the conclusion asserts that ETS doesn't administer tests internationally, which contradicts one of the premises.
Processed: Uncertain

Generation 4:
TEXT: ETS develops various standardized tests primarily in the United States for K-12 and higher education.
FOL: all x. (Develops(ETS, x) -> (StandardizedTest(x) & In(x, UnitedStates) & For(x, k12OrHigherEducation)))

TEXT: ETS administers international tests, including the TOEFL, TOEIC, GRE, and subject tests.
FOL: all x. (Administers(ETS, x) -> (InternationalTest(x) & (TOEFL(x) | TOEIC(x) | GRE(x) | SubjectTest(x))))

TEXT: Many of the assessments ETS develops are associated with entry to the US tertiary and quaternary education institutions.
FOL: all x. (Develops(ETS, x) -> AssociatedWith(x, EntryToUSeducationInstitutions))

TEXT: ETS also develops K-12 statewide assessments used for accountability testing in many states.
FOL: all x. (Develops(ETS, x) -> (StateWideAssessment(x) & UsedFor(x, AccountabilityTesting)))

TEXT: ETS doesn't administer tests internationally.
FOL: all x. (Administers(ETS, x) -> In(x, UnitedStates))

In this case, the conclusion does not follow from the premises because the premises do not restrict the administration of tests to the United States only. The premises only state that many of the assessments developed by ETS are associated with entry to US education institutions, but they do not explicitly state that the tests are administered only in the United States. Therefore, it is possible for ETS to administer international tests, which contradicts the conclusion.
Processed: Uncertain

Generation 5:
TEXT: ETS develops various standardized tests primarily in the United States for K-12 and higher education.
FOL: all x. (Develops(ETS, x) -> (In(x, UnitedStates) & (For(x, K12) | For(x, HigherEducation))))

TEXT: ETS administers international tests, including the TOEFL, TOEIC, GRE, and subject tests.
FOL: all x. (Administration(ETS, x) -> (International(x) & (TOEFL(x) | TOEIC(x) | GRE(x) | SubjectTest(x))))

TEXT: Many of the assessments ETS develops are associated with entry to the US tertiary and quaternary education institutions.
FOL: some x. (Develops(ETS, x) & AssociatedWith(x, EntryToUSeducationInstitutions))

TEXT: ETS also develops K-12 statewide assessments used for accountability testing in many states.
FOL: all y. (Develops(ETS, y) -> (Statewide(y) & AccountabilityTesting(y)))

TEXT: ETS doesn't administer tests internationally.
FOL: all x. (Administration(ETS, x) -> -International(x))

In the provided conclusion, it is not implied that ETS doesn't develop tests internationally. Therefore, the given conclusion does not follow from the given premises. However, the conclusion "ETS doesn't develop tests internationally" does not contradict any of the given premises either.

TEXT: The Harry Potter series of books is Heptalogy.
FOL: HarryPotterSeries(y) -> Heptalogyy(y)

FOL expressions translate the given text into FOL format, where the variables x, y, and z represent different works. The expressions state that a Heptalogy is a compound literary or narrative work consisting of seven distinct works, the Harry Potter series consists of seven distinct works, the Chronicles of Narnia consists of seven distinct works, and if the Harry Potter series consists of seven distinct works, then it is a Heptalogy. The theorem solver can now use these expressions to determine whether the conclusion follows from the premises.

TEXT: The Harry Potter series of books is Heptalogy.
FOL: Heptalogy(HarryPotterSeries)

In the given conclusion, it's assumed that 'Harry Potter Series' represents the individual books as a whole. However, if each individual book is considered as a separate entity, then the conclusion would not hold true. The given premises don't provide enough information to conclude that each book in the Harry Potter series is a distinct work within Heptalogy. To make the conclusion accurate, one would need additional premises stating that each book in the Harry Potter series is a distinct work and part of Heptalogy.

In this case, the conclusion doesn't necessarily follow from the premises. The conclusion states that the Harry Potter series is Heptalogy, but it doesn't specify which of the seven distinct works belong to the Harry Potter series. If we assume that the seven distinct works mentioned in the premises are the seven books of the Harry Potter series, then the conclusion would be valid. However, without additional information, it's not possible to definitively say that the Harry Potter series is Heptalogy.

FOL: UnderGPL(TOra)

TEXT: TOra is a free software.
FOL: Free(TOra)

In this case, since TOra is under the GNU General Public License, it is not paid software. Therefore, it is free software.
Processed: True

Generation 5:
TEXT: TOra is a GUI.
FOL: GUI(TOra)

TEXT: GUIs are software.
FOL: all x. (GUI(x) -> Software(x))

TEXT: TOra is under the GNU General Public License.
FOL: UnderGPL(TOra)

TEXT: TOra is a free software.
FOL: FreeSoftware(TOra)

To determine whether the conclusion follows from the premises, we can use the contrapositive argument:
If it were not the case that TOra is free software, then it would not be under the GNU General Public License.
Since we know that TOra is under the GNU General Public License, it must be the case that TOra is free software.
Therefore, the conclusion follows from the premises.

FOL: all x. ((-FreeSoftware(x) & GUI(x)) -> -UnderGPL(x))
all x. (UnderGPL(x) -> FreeSoftware(x))
FreeSoftware(TOra)

FOL: all x. (PaidSoftware(x) -> -UnderGPL(x))

TEXT: TOra is under the GNU General Public License.
FOL: UnderGPL(TOra)

TEXT: TOra is a free software.
FOL: FreeSoftware(TOra)

To evaluate whether the conclusion follows from the premises, we can use the Prover9 theorem prover to find a proof or counterexample. In this case, we can infer that TOra is free software because it is not paid software (since it is under the GNU General Public License) and paid software is not under the GNU General Public License. Therefore, the conclusion follows from the premises.

FOL: (PaidSoftware(TOra) -> -UnderGPL(TOra)) & (-PaidSoftware(TOra)) & (PaidSoftware(x) -> -FreeSoftware(x)) -> FreeSoftware(TOra)
Processed: True

Generation 9:

TEXT: TOra is under the GNU General Public License.
FOL: UnderGNUGPL(TOra)

TEXT: TOra is a free software.
FOL: FreeSoftware(TOra)

In this case, since TOra is under the GNU General Public License, which is a free software license, it follows that TOra is a free software. The conclusion follows from the premises.

FOL: FreeSoftware(TOra) <- UnderGNUGPL(TOra) & all x. (PaidSoftware(x) -> -UnderGNUGPL(x)) & all x. (Software(x) -> (FreeSoftware(x) | PaidSoftware(x))) & all x. (GUI(x) -> Software(x)) & GUI(TOra)

Ableton does not have an office in Germany.
</CONCLUSION>
<EVALUATE>

Generation 1:
TEXT: Ableton has an office in Germany.
FOL: OfficeIn(Ableton, Germany)
TEXT: Ableton has an office in the USA.
FOL: OfficeIn(Ableton, USA)
TEXT: USA and Germany are different countries.
FOL: DifferentCountries(USA, Germany)
TEXT: Any company that has offices in different countries is a multinational company.
FOL: all x. (OfficeIn(x, y) & OfficeIn(x, z) & DifferentCountries(y, z) -> MultinationalCompany(x))
TEXT: Ableton makes music software.
FOL: Makes(Ableton, MusicSoftware)
TEXT: Ableton does not have an office in Germany.
FOL: -MultinationalCompany(Ableton)

To evaluate whether the conclusion follows from the premises, we need to find a contradiction. If Ableton has offices in both Germany and the USA (as per the first two premises), it should be a multinational company (as per the fourth premise). But it's not (as per the last line of FOL expressions), which is a contradiction. Therefore, the conclusion does not follow from the premises.
Processed: False

Generation 2:
TEXT: Ableton has an office in Germany.
FOL: OfficeIn(Ableton, Germany)

TEXT: Ableton has an office in the USA.
FOL: OfficeIn(Ableton, USA)

TEXT: USA and Germany are different countries.
FOL: DifferentCountries(USA, Germany)

TEXT: Any company that has offices in different countries is a multinational company.
FOL: all x. (and(OfficeIn(x, y), OfficeIn(x, z), DifferentCountries(y, z)) -> MultinationalCompany(x))

TEXT: Ableton makes music software.
FOL: Makes(Ableton, MusicSoftware)

TEXT: Ableton does not have an office in Germany.
FOL: -MultinationalCompany(Ableton)

In this case, the premises are not sufficient to conclude that Ableton does not have an office in Germany. The conclusion contradicts the first premise.
Processed: Error

Generation 3:
TEXT: Ableton has an office in Germany.
FOL: OfficeIn(Ableton, Germany)

TEXT: Ableton has an office in the USA.
FOL: OfficeIn(Ableton, USA)

TEXT: USA and Germany are different countries.
FOL: DifferentCountry(USA, Germany)

TEXT: Any company that has offices in different countries is a multinational company.
FOL: all x. (OfficeIn(x, y) & OfficeIn(x, z) & DifferentCountry(y, z) -> MultinationalCompany(x))

TEXT: Ableton makes music software.
FOL: MakesMusicSoftware(Ableton)

TEXT: Ableton does not have an office in Germany.
FOL: -OfficeIn(Ableton, Germany)

The given conclusion contradicts the first premise, so it does not follow from the premises. The theorem solver would determine that the conclusion is false.
Processed: False

Generation 4:
TEXT: Ableton has an office in Germany.
FOL: OfficeIn(Ableton, Germany)

TEXT: Ableton has an office in the USA.
FOL: OfficeIn(Ableton, USA)

TEXT: USA and Germany are different countries.
FOL: DifferentCountry(USA, Germany)

TEXT: Any company that has offices in different countries is a multinational company.
FOL: all x. (OfficeIn(x, y) & OfficeIn(x, z) & DifferentCountry(y, z) -> MultinationalCompany(x))

TEXT: Ableton makes music software.
FOL: Makes(Ableton, MusicSoftware)

TEXT: Ableton does not have an office in Germany.
FOL: -MultinationalCompany(Ableton)
Processed: False

Generation 5:
TEXT: Ableton has an office in Germany.
FOL: OfficeIn(Ableton, Germany)
TEXT: Ableton has an office in the USA.
FOL: OfficeIn(Ableton, USA)
TEXT: USA and Germany are different countries.
FOL: DifferentCountries(USA, Germany)
TEXT: Any company that has offices in different countries is a multinational company.
FOL: all x. (OfficeIn(x, y) & OfficeIn(x, z) & DifferentCountries(y, z) -> MultinationalCompany(x))
TEXT: Ableton makes music software.
FOL: MakesMusicSoftware(Ableton)
TEXT: Ableton does not have an office in Germany.
FOL: -OfficeIn(Ableton, Germany)

In the given FOL expressions, the conclusion does not follow from the premises because the premises do not state that Ableton has offices only in Germany and the USA. The premises only state that Ableton has offices in these two countries, but they do not rule out the possibility that Ableton has offices in other countries as well. Therefore, Ableton cannot be determined to be a multinational company based on the given premises, and it is possible that Ableton has an office in Germany. Hence, the conclusion does not follow from the premises.
Processed: False

Generation 6:
TEXT: Ableton has an office in Germany.
FOL: Office(Ableton, Germany)

TEXT: Ableton has an office in the USA.
FOL: Office(Ableton, USA)

TEXT: USA and Germany are different countries.
FOL: DifferentCountries(USA, Germany)

TEXT: Any company that has offices in different countries is a multinational company.
FOL: all x. (Office(x, y) & Office(x, z) & DifferentCountries(y, z) -> MultinationalCompany(x))

TEXT: Ableton makes music software.
FOL: Makes(Ableton, MusicSoftware)

TEXT: Ableton does not have an office in Germany.
FOL: -MultinationalCompany(Ableton)

In this case, the premises do not imply the conclusion. Ableton having offices in both the USA and Germany does not necessarily mean that it is not a multinational company. However, the conclusion states that Ableton does not have an office in Germany, which contradicts the first premise. Therefore, the conclusion does not follow from the premises.
Processed: False

Generation 7:
TEXT: Ableton has an office in Germany.
FOL: OfficeIn(Ableton, Germany)
TEXT: Ableton has an office in the USA.
FOL: OfficeIn(Ableton, USA)
TEXT: USA and Germany are different countries.
FOL: DifferentCountries(USA, Germany)
TEXT: Any company that has offices in different countries is a multinational company.
FOL: all x. (OfficeIn(x, y) & OfficeIn(x, z) & DifferentCountries(y, z) -> MultinationalCompany(x))
TEXT: Ableton makes music software.
FOL: MakesMusicSoftware(Ableton)
TEXT: Ableton does not have an office in Germany.
FOL: -MultinationalCompany(Ableton)

In this case, the premises state that Ableton has offices in both Germany and the USA, and that Germany and the USA are different countries. The conclusion states that Ableton does not have an office in Germany, which contradicts the premises. Therefore, the conclusion does not follow from the premises.
Processed: False

Generation 8:
TEXT: Ableton has an office in Germany.
FOL: hasOfficeIn(Ableton, Germany)
TEXT: Ableton has an office in the USA.
FOL: hasOfficeIn(Ableton, USA)
TEXT: USA and Germany are different countries.
FOL: differentCountries(USA, Germany)
TEXT: Any company that has offices in different countries is a multinational company.
FOL: all x. (and(hasOfficeIn(x, y1), hasOfficeIn(x, y2)) -> MultinationalCompany(x) where y1 != y2)
TEXT: Ableton makes music software.
FOL: makes(Ableton, MusicSoftware)
TEXT: Ableton does not have an office in Germany.
FOL: -MultinationalCompany(Ableton)

In this case, the premises imply that Ableton is a multinational company because it has offices in two different countries (USA and Germany). However, the premise about multinational companies states that any company with offices in different countries is a multinational company. Since Ableton is a multinational company, it must have offices in both USA and Germany. Therefore, the conclusion that Ableton does not have an office in Germany is incorrect.
Processed: Error

Generation 9:
TEXT: Ableton has an office in Germany.
FOL: OfficeIn(Ableton, Germany)
TEXT: Ableton has an office in the USA.
FOL: OfficeIn(Ableton, USA)
TEXT: USA and Germany are different countries.
FOL: Different(USA, Germany)
TEXT: Any company that has offices in different countries is a multinational company.
FOL: all x. ((OfficeIn(x, y) & Different(y, z)) -> MultinationalCompany(x) & (y != z))
TEXT: Ableton makes music software.
FOL: MakesMusicSoftware(Ableton)
TEXT: Ableton does not have an office in Germany.
FOL: -MultinationalCompany(Ableton)

In this case, the premises state that Ableton has offices in Germany and the USA, and Germany and the USA are different countries. The premise also states that any company with offices in different countries is a multinational company. However, the conclusion is that Ableton does not have an office in Germany, which contradicts the first premise. Therefore, the conclusion does not follow from the premises.
Processed: True

Generation 10:
TEXT: Ableton has an office in Germany.
FOL: Office(Ableton, Germany)

TEXT: Ableton has an office in the USA.
FOL: Office(Ableton, USA)

FOL: Different(USA, Germany)

TEXT: Any company that has offices in different countries is a multinational company.
FOL: all x. (Office(x, c1) & Office(x, c2) & Different(c1, c2) -> MultinationalCompany(x))

TEXT: Ableton makes music software.
FOL: Make(Ableton, MusicSoftware)

TEXT: Ableton does not have an office in Germany.
FOL: -MultinationalCompany(Ableton)

The conclusion does not follow from the premises. The premises only state that Ableton has offices in both Germany and the USA, and that these countries are different. They do not provide information about the number of countries in which Ableton has offices, which is necessary to determine if it is a multinational company. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that Ableton does not have an office in Germany.

Generation 1:
TEXT: When something is depressing, it is sad.
FOL: Depressing(x) -> Sad(x)

TEXT: The end of a relationship is depressing.
FOL: Depressing(EndOfRelationship)

TEXT: The end of a relationship is invigorating
FOL: EndOfRelationship -> Invigorating(EndOfRelationship)

The given premises do not imply the given conclusion. The conclusion states that the end of a relationship is invigorating, but according to the premises, it is depressing, not invigorating. Therefore, the conclusion does not follow from the premises.
Processed: Error

Generation 2:
TEXT: When something is depressing, it is sad.
FOL: all x. (Depressing(x) -> Sad(x))
TEXT: The end of a relationship is depressing.
FOL: Depressing(EndOfRelationship)
TEXT: The end of a relationship is invigorating
FOL: -Sad(EndOfRelationship)

This conclusion does not follow from the given premises as the premises do not state or imply that the end of a relationship is invigorating.
Processed: False

Generation 3:
TEXT: When something is depressing, it is sad.
FOL: all x. (Depressing(x) -> Sad(x))

TEXT: The end of a relationship is depressing.
FOL: Depressing(EndOfRelationship)

TEXT: The end of a relationship is invigorating
FOL: Invigorating(EndOfRelationship)

Since the FOL sentence Depressing(EndOfRelationship) is true according to the premises and the FOL sentence Invigorating(EndOfRelationship) is the conclusion, which contradicts the premises, the conclusion does not follow from the premises.
Processed: Uncertain

Generation 4:
TEXT: When something is depressing, it is sad.
FOL: all x. (Depressing(x) -> Sad(x))
TEXT: The end of a relationship is depressing.
FOL: Depressing(EndOfRelationship)
TEXT: The end of a relationship is invigorating
FOL: False
</EVALUATE>

The conclusion does not follow from the premises because the premises do not state or imply that the end of a relationship is invigorating. They only state that it is depressing, which means it is sad according to the given definition.
Processed: Uncertain

Generation 5:
TEXT: When something is depressing, it is sad.
FOL: all x. (Depressing(x) -> Sad(x))
TEXT: The end of a relationship is depressing.
FOL: Depressing(EndOfARelationship)
TEXT: The end of a relationship is invigorating
FOL: False (since the premises do not support this conclusion)
Processed: Uncertain

Generation 6:
TEXT: When something is depressing, it is sad.
FOL: all x. (Depressing(x) -> Sad(x))
TEXT: The end of a relationship is depressing.
FOL: Depressing(EndOfRelationship)
TEXT: The end of a relationship is invigorating
FOL: -Sad(EndOfRelationship)

The given conclusion contradicts the premise, so it does not follow from the premises.
Processed: False

Generation 7:
TEXT: When something is depressing, it is sad.
FOL: all x. (Depressing(x) -> Sad(x))

TEXT: The end of a relationship is depressing.
FOL: Depressing(EndOfRelationship)

TEXT: The end of a relationship is invigorating
FOL: -Depressing(EndOfRelationship)

This conclusion does not follow from the given premises. The end of a relationship is described as depressing, not invigorating.
Processed: False

Generation 8:
TEXT: When something is depressing, it is sad.
FOL: all x. (Depressing(x) -> Sad(x))
TEXT: The end of a relationship is depressing.
FOL: Depressing(EndOfARelationship)
TEXT: The end of a relationship is invigorating
FOL: -Sad(EndOfARelationship)

The conclusion does not follow from the premises because the premises state that depressing things are sad, and the end of a relationship is depressing, but they do not state or imply that the end of a relationship is invigorating.
Processed: False

Generation 9:
TEXT: When something is depressing, it is sad.
FOL: all x. (Depressing(x) -> Sad(x))
TEXT: The end of a relationship is depressing.
FOL: Depressing(EndOfRelationship)
TEXT: The end of a relationship is invigorating
FOL: -Sad(EndOfRelationship)

However, it is important to note that the conclusion does not follow logically from the premises. The premises state that something being depressing makes it sad, and the end of a relationship is depressing, but they do not provide any information about the end of a relationship being invigorating.
Processed: False

Generation 10:
TEXT: When something is depressing, it is sad.
FOL: all x. (Depressing(x) -> Sad(x))
TEXT: The end of a relationship is depressing.
FOL: Depressing(EndOfARelationship)
TEXT: The end of a relationship is invigorating
FOL: -(Depressing(EndOfARelationship) -> Invigorating(EndOfARelationship))

This conclusion does not follow from the premises as the premises only state that depressing things are sad, and the end of a relationship is identified as depressing, but not as invigorating.
Processed: Uncertain

In this case, the conclusion does not follow from the premises. The premises state that China and India are both BRICS countries with emerging economies, and that being from China or India means being from a BRICS country. However, there is no information provided about India's economy being not emerging. Therefore, the conclusion cannot be logically derived from the premises.

In this case, the conclusion does not follow from the premises. The premises only state that China and India are BRICS countries with emerging economies, and that people from these countries are from BRICS countries. They do not say anything about the economy of India not being emerging. The statement "There is a person from India" implies that India is not completely devoid of people, but it does not provide enough information to conclude anything about its economy.

Generation 1:
TEXT: Soccer players have a right foot and a left foot.
FOL: all x. (SoccerPlayer(x) -> HasRightFoot(x) & HasLeftFoot(x))

TEXT: Top soccer players are soccer players who can use both the left foot and right foot very efficiently.

TEXT: Cristiano Ronaldo has scored many goals using his left foot.
FOL: CanScoreManyGoalsWithLeftFoot(CristianoRonaldo)

TEXT: Cristiano Ronaldo is not a top soccer player.
FOL: -TopSoccerPlayer(CristianoRonaldo)

This conclusion does not follow from the given premises. Cristiano Ronaldo's ability to score many goals with his left foot does not necessarily mean he cannot use that foot efficiently, nor does it mean he cannot use his right foot efficiently. The premises only state that if a player can score many goals using a foot, they can use that foot efficiently. The premises do not state that a player must be able to use both feet efficiently to be a top soccer player. Therefore, the conclusion is not valid.
Processed: Uncertain

Generation 2:

TEXT: Cristiano Ronaldo has scored many goals using his left foot.
FOL: CanScoreManyGoalsWithLeftFoot(CristianoRonaldo)

TEXT: Cristiano Ronaldo is not a top soccer player.
FOL: -TopSoccerPlayer(CristianoRonaldo)

This conclusion does not follow from the given premises, as the premises do not provide enough information about Cristiano Ronaldo's efficiency with his left foot. The premises state that if a player can score many goals with a foot, they can use that foot efficiently, but they do not state that a player must score many goals with both feet to be a top soccer player.
Processed: Uncertain

Generation 3:

FOL: all x. (SoccerPlayer(x) -> (HasRightFoot(x) & HasLeftFoot(x)))
TEXT: Top soccer players are soccer players who can use both the left foot and right foot very efficiently.
FOL: all x. (TopSoccerPlayer(x) -> (CanUseLeftFoot(x) & CanUseRightFoot(x)))
TEXT: If a soccer player can score many goals using the left foot, they can use that foot very efficiently.
FOL: all x. (CanScoreManyGoalsUsingLeftFoot(x) -> CanUseLeftFoot(x))
TEXT: If a soccer player can score many goals using the right foot, they can use that foot very efficiently.

TEXT: Cristiano Ronaldo has scored many goals using his left foot.
FOL: CanScoreManyGoalsUsingLeftFoot(CristianoRonaldo)
TEXT: Cristiano Ronaldo is not a top soccer player.
FOL: -TopSoccerPlayer(CristianoRonaldo)

In this case, Cristiano Ronaldo can score many goals using his left foot, but it is not stated that he can use his left foot very efficiently. Therefore, according to the given premises, he is not considered a top soccer player.
Processed: Uncertain

Generation 4:
TEXT: Soccer players have a right foot and a left foot.
FOL: all x. (SoccerPlayer(x) -> (HasRightFoot(x) & HasLeftFoot(x)))

TEXT: Top soccer players are soccer players who can use both the left foot and right foot very efficiently.
FOL: all x. (TopSoccerPlayer(x) -> (EfficientlyUsesLeftFoot(x) & EfficientlyUsesRightFoot(x)))

TEXT: If a soccer player can score many goals using the left foot, they can use that foot very efficiently.
FOL: all x. (CanScoreManyGoalsUsingLeftFoot(x) -> EfficientlyUsesLeftFoot(x))

TEXT: If a soccer player can score many goals using the right foot, they can use that foot very efficiently.
FOL: all x. (CanScoreManyGoalsUsingRightFoot(x) -> EfficientlyUsesRightFoot(x))

TEXT: Cristiano Ronaldo is a soccer player.
FOL: SoccerPlayer(CristianoRonaldo)

TEXT: Cristiano Ronaldo has scored many goals using his left foot.
FOL: CanScoreManyGoalsUsingLeftFoot(CristianoRonaldo)

TEXT: Cristiano Ronaldo is not a top soccer player.
FOL: -TopSoccerPlayer(CristianoRonaldo)

To determine whether the conclusion follows from the premises, we need to evaluate whether the premises allow us to deduce the conclusion. In this case, the premises tell us that Cristiano Ronaldo can score many goals using his left foot, but they do not guarantee that he can use his left foot very efficiently. Therefore, we cannot deduce that Cristiano Ronaldo is a top soccer player from the given premises.
Processed: Uncertain

Generation 5:

TEXT: Cristiano Ronaldo has scored many goals using his left foot.
FOL: CanScoreManyGoalsUsingLeftFoot(CristianoRonaldo)
TEXT: Cristiano Ronaldo is not a top soccer player.
FOL: -TopSoccerPlayer(CristianoRonaldo)

In this case, Cristiano Ronaldo can score many goals using his left foot, but we don't have information about his efficiency with the left foot. Since the definition of a top soccer player requires efficiency with both feet, we cannot conclude that Cristiano Ronaldo is a top soccer player based on the given premises.

TEXT: Cristiano Ronaldo has scored many goals using his left foot.
FOL: CanScoreManyGoalsUsingLeftFoot(CristianoRonaldo)

TEXT: Cristiano Ronaldo is not a top soccer player.
FOL: -TopSoccerPlayer(CristianoRonaldo)

The conclusion does not follow from the premises because Cristiano Ronaldo can use his right foot very efficiently (according to the premises), but the premises do not provide sufficient information about his ability to use his left foot efficiently. The premises state that if a soccer player can score many goals using a foot, they can use that foot efficiently, but they do not specify a minimum number of goals required for efficiency. Therefore, it is possible that Cristiano Ronaldo can use his left foot efficiently, but the premises do not provide enough evidence to support this claim.

However, based on the given information, we cannot definitively conclude that Cristiano Ronaldo is not a top soccer player. The given premises do not provide enough information to determine if he is efficient with his left foot. If we assume that Cristiano Ronaldo is not efficient with his left foot, then we could conclude that he is not a top soccer player. But without that assumption, we cannot definitively say that he is not a top soccer player.

To evaluate this more accurately, we would need additional information about Cristiano Ronaldo's efficiency with his left foot.

TEXT: The National Lobster Hatchery is not for profit.
FOL: -ForProfit(TheNationalLobsterHatchery)
TEXT: The National Lobster Hatchery is for conservation.
FOL: ForConservation(TheNationalLobsterHatchery)

In this case, we can conclude that the National Lobster Hatchery is for conservation because it is not for profit and, by definition, all hatcheries are either for profit or for conservation. Since it is not for profit, it must be for conservation. Additionally, if a hatchery is for conservation, it might release animals into the wild, but this fact is not necessary to prove that the National Lobster Hatchery is for conservation.

Generation 1:
TEXT: All horses have hooves.
FOL: all x. (Horse(x) -> HasHooves(x))
TEXT: No humans have hooves.
FOL: all x. (-Human(x) v HasHooves(x))
TEXT: Some humans are horses.
FOL: exists x. (Human(x) & Horse(x))

In this case, the conclusion does not follow from the premises. Humans and horses are distinct species, and there is no evidence to suggest that any human is a horse or vice versa.
Processed: Error

Generation 2:
TEXT: All horses have hooves.
FOL: all x. (Horse(x) -> Has(x, Hooves))
TEXT: No humans have hooves.
FOL: all x. (Human(x) -> -Has(x, Hooves))
TEXT: Some humans are horses.
FOL: exists x. (Human(x) & Horse(x))

In this case, the conclusion does not follow from the premises because humans and horses are distinct species and no human is a horse according to the given premises.
Processed: False

Generation 3:
TEXT: All horses have hooves.
FOL: all x. (Horse(x) -> HasHooves(x))
TEXT: No humans have hooves.
FOL: all x. (-Human(x) v HasHooves(x))
TEXT: Some humans are horses.
FOL: exists x. (Human(x) & Horse(x))

This is a contradiction, as the premises state that no humans have hooves and all horses have hooves, making it impossible for any human to be a horse. Therefore, the conclusion "Some humans are horses" does not follow from the premises.
Processed: Error

Generation 4:
TEXT: All horses have hooves.
FOL: all x. (Horse(x) -> HasHooves(x))
TEXT: No humans have hooves.
FOL: all x. (-Human(x) v HasHooves(x))
TEXT: Some humans are horses.
FOL: exists x. (Human(x) & Horse(x))

In this case, the conclusion does not follow from the premises. There is no information in the premises that suggests any humans are horses.
Processed: Error

Generation 5:

FOL: all x. (Horse(x) -> HasHooves(x))
TEXT: No humans have hooves.
FOL: all x. (-Human(x) | -HasHooves(x))
TEXT: Some humans are horses.
FOL: exists x. (Human(x) & Horse(x))

The conclusion does not follow from the premises because the premises state that all horses have hooves and no humans have hooves. Therefore, no human can be a horse.
Processed: False

Generation 6:
TEXT: All horses have hooves.
FOL: all x. (Horse(x) -> HasHooves(x))
TEXT: No humans have hooves.
FOL: all x. (-Human(x) v HasHooves(x))
TEXT: Some humans are horses.
FOL: exists x. (Human(x) & Horse(x))

In this case, the conclusion does not follow from the premises. Humans and horses are two distinct species and one is not the other, so it is impossible for a human to be a horse.
Processed: Error

TEXT: No humans have hooves.
FOL: all x. (-(Human(x) & HasHooves(x)))
TEXT: Some humans are horses.
FOL: exists x. (Human(x) & Horse(x))

In this case, the conclusion does not follow from the premises. Humans and horses are distinct species, so it is not possible for a human to be a horse. Therefore, there are no humans that are horses.
Processed: False

Generation 8:
TEXT: All horses have hooves.
FOL: all x. (Horse(x) -> Has(x, Hooves))
TEXT: No humans have hooves.
FOL: all x. (-(Human(x) & Has(x, Hooves)))
TEXT: Some humans are horses.
FOL: exists x. (Human(x) & Horse(x))

The given premises state that all horses have hooves and no humans have hooves. The conclusion, however, states that some humans are horses, which is false given the provided premises. Therefore, the conclusion does not follow from the premises.
Processed: False

Generation 9:
TEXT: All horses have hooves.

TEXT: Grebes are not mammals.
FOL: -Mammal(Grebe)

In this problem, we are given several statements about different types of animals. We are asked to determine if the conclusion follows from the given premises. The conclusion is that Grebes are not mammals.

To evaluate this, we can first list the premises:

1. The only types of mammals that lay eggs are either platypuses or echidnas.
2. Platypuses are not hyrax.
3. Echidnas are not hyrax.
4. No mammals are invertebrates.
5. All animals are either vertebrates or invertebrates.
6. Mammals are animals.
7. Hyraxes are mammals.
8. Grebes lay eggs.
9. Grebes are not platypuses and also not echidnas.

From premises 1, 2, and 3, we can deduce that if an animal lays eggs and is not a platypus or an echidna, then it is not a mammal. Premise 9 tells us that Grebes are not platypuses or echidnas. Therefore, Grebes are not mammals.

This deduction is consistent with the given premises, so the conclusion follows from the premises.

In this case, the conclusion follows logically from the premises. If grebes are not platypuses and not echidnas (both of which are the only egg-laying mammals), and they are not mammals at all, then they must be invertebrates (since all animals are either vertebrates or invertebrates). However, we also know that no mammals are invertebrates, so grebes cannot be mammals. Therefore, grebes must be invertebrates. But we have not been given any information about grebes being invertebrates, so the conclusion that grebes are not mammals follows logically, but the premises do not logically imply that grebes are invertebrates.

Generation 1:
TEXT: The Mona Lisa is a world's best-known painting.
FOL: BestKnownPainting(MonaLisa)

TEXT: The Mona Lisa is a portrait painted by Leonardo da Vinci.
FOL: Portrait(MonaLisa) & PaintedBy(LeonardoDaVinci, MonaLisa)

TEXT: Leonardo da Vinci was a scientist and painter.
FOL: Scientist(LeonardoDaVinci) & Painter(LeonardoDaVinci)

TEXT: Painting genres can be history, portrait, animal, landscape, and still life.
FOL: exists x. (Genre(x) & (History(x) | Portrait(x) | Animal(x) | Landscape(x) | StillLife(x)))

TEXT: No world's best-known artworks are portraits.
FOL: -(exists x. BestKnownArtwork(x) & Portrait(x))

In this case, the conclusion does not follow from the premises. The Mona Lisa, as a world's best-known painting, is indeed a portrait, so there is at least one world's best-known artwork that is a portrait. Therefore, the conclusion is false.
Processed: Uncertain

Generation 2:
TEXT: The Mona Lisa is a world's best-known painting.
FOL: WorldsBestKnownPainting(MonaLisa)

TEXT: The Mona Lisa is a portrait painted by Leonardo da Vinci.
FOL: Portrait(MonaLisa) & PaintedBy(LeonardoDaVinci, MonaLisa)

FOL: BestKnownPainting(MonaLisa)

TEXT: The Mona Lisa is a portrait painted by Leonardo da Vinci.
FOL: Portrait(MonaLisa) & PaintedBy(LeonardoDaVinci, MonaLisa)

TEXT: Leonardo da Vinci was a scientist and painter.
FOL: Scientist(LeonardoDaVinci) & Painter(LeonardoDaVinci)

TEXT: Painting genres can be history, portrait, animal, landscape, and still life.
FOL: exists x. (PaintingGenre(x) & (x=History) | (x=Portrait) | (x=Animal) | (x=Landscape) | (x=StillLife))

TEXT: No world's best-known artworks are portraits.
FOL: -(exists x. (BestKnownArtwork(x) & Portrait(x)))

In this case, the conclusion does not follow from the premises. The Mona Lisa is a world's best-known painting and it is a portrait, so the conclusion is not true.
Processed: Error

Generation 4:
TEXT: The Mona Lisa is a world's best-known painting.
FOL: WorldsBestKnownPainting(MonaLisa)
TEXT: The Mona Lisa is a portrait painted by Leonardo da Vinci.
FOL: Portrait(MonaLisa) & PaintedBy(LeonardoDaVinci, MonaLisa)
TEXT: Leonardo da Vinci was a scientist and painter.

TEXT: Painting genres can be history, portrait, animal, landscape, and still life.
FOL: exists x. (Genre(x) & (History(x) | Portrait(x) | Animal(x) | Landscape(x) | StillLife(x)))
TEXT: No world's best-known artworks are portraits.
FOL: -(exists x. (WorldsBestKnownArtwork(x) & Portrait(x)))

In this case, the conclusion does not follow from the premises. The Mona Lisa is a world-famous painting, and it happens to be a portrait. However, the premises do not provide any information about other world-famous artworks, so it cannot be concluded that no such artworks are portraits.
Processed: Uncertain

Generation 5:
TEXT: The Mona Lisa is a world's best-known painting.
FOL: BestKnownPainting(MonaLisa)

TEXT: The Mona Lisa is a portrait painted by Leonardo da Vinci.
FOL: Portrait(MonaLisa) & PaintedBy(LeonardoDaVinci, MonaLisa)

TEXT: Leonardo da Vinci was a scientist and painter.

TEXT: Painting genres can be history, portrait, animal, landscape, and still life.
FOL: Genre(Portrait) & Genre(History) & Genre(Animal) & Genre(Landscape) & Genre(StillLife)

TEXT: No world's best-known artworks are portraits.
FOL: all x. (BestKnownArtwork(x) -> -Portrait(x))

Since the Mona Lisa is a portrait, it is not a world's best-known artwork, which contradicts the given premises. Therefore, the conclusion does not follow from the premises.

However, if we make an additional assumption that there is only one world's best-known artwork, then the conclusion could be valid. But without this assumption, the conclusion cannot be logically deduced from the given premises.
Processed: Error

Generation 6:
TEXT: The Mona Lisa is a world's best-known painting.
FOL: WorldsBestKnownPainting(MonaLisa)
TEXT: The Mona Lisa is a portrait painted by Leonardo da Vinci.

TEXT: No world's best-known artworks are portraits.
FOL: -exists x. (WorldsBestKnownArtwork(x) & Portrait(x))

In this case, the premises do not imply the conclusion. The Mona Lisa being a world's best-known painting and being a portrait doesn't mean that all world's best-known artworks are portraits. There could be other world's best-known artworks that are not portraits.
Processed: Error

Generation 7:
TEXT: The Mona Lisa is a world's best-known painting.
FOL: bestKnown(MonaLisa, Painting)

TEXT: The Mona Lisa is a portrait painted by Leonardo da Vinci.
FOL: Portrait(MonaLisa) & PaintedBy(LeonardoDaVinci, MonaLisa)

FOL: (HistoryPainting | PortraitPainting | AnimalPainting | LandscapePainting | StillLifePainting)

TEXT: No world's best-known artworks are portraits.
FOL: -(exists x. (bestKnown(x, Artwork) & Portrait(x)))

This conclusion does not follow from the premises. The Mona Lisa being a portrait does not imply that no world's best-known artworks are portraits.
Processed: Uncertain

FOL: BestKnownPainting(MonaLisa)
TEXT: The Mona Lisa is a portrait painted by Leonardo da Vinci.

TEXT: No world's best-known artworks are portraits.
FOL: -(exists x. (Artwork(x) & BestKnown(x) & Portrait(x)))

In this case, the conclusion does not follow from the premises. The Mona Lisa, a portrait, is a world's best-known artwork according to the premises, so the conclusion is false.

TEXT: No world's best-known artworks are portraits.
FOL: -exists x. (BestKnown(x, Artwork) & Portrait(x))

The given conclusion is not logically followable from the given premises. The Mona Lisa is a portrait, and it is one of the world's best-known artworks. Therefore, it contradicts the conclusion that no world's best-known artworks are portraits.

<EVALUATE>

Generation 1:
TEXT: If a person is hungry, the person is uncomfortable.
FOL: all x. (Hungry(x) -> Uncomfortable(x))
TEXT: If a person is uncomfortable, the person is unhappy.
FOL: all x. (Uncomfortable(x) -> Unhappy(x))
TEXT: If a person is not hungry, the person is unhappy.
FOL: all x. (-Hungry(x) -> Unhappy(x))

In this case, the conclusion follows logically from the premises. If a person is not hungry, then they are not uncomfortable, and since being uncomfortable leads to being unhappy, they must be unhappy.
Processed: Uncertain

Generation 2:
TEXT: If a person is hungry, the person is uncomfortable.
FOL: all x. (Hungry(x) -> Uncomfortable(x))
TEXT: If a person is uncomfortable, the person is unhappy.
FOL: all x. (Uncomfortable(x) -> Unhappy(x))
TEXT: If a person is not hungry, the person is unhappy.
FOL: all x. (-Hungry(x) -> Unhappy(x))

In this case, the conclusion follows logically from the premises. If a person is not hungry, then they are not uncomfortable (by the first premise), and therefore they are unhappy (by the second premise).
Processed: Uncertain

Generation 3:
TEXT: If a person is hungry, the person is uncomfortable.
FOL: all x. (Hungry(x) -> Uncomfortable(x))
TEXT: If a person is uncomfortable, the person is unhappy.

Generation 4:
TEXT: If a person is hungry, the person is uncomfortable.
FOL: all x. (Hungry(x) -> Uncomfortable(x))

TEXT: If a person is uncomfortable, the person is unhappy.
FOL: all x. (Uncomfortable(x) -> Unhappy(x))

TEXT: If a person is not hungry, the person is unhappy.

Generation 5:
TEXT: If a person is hungry, the person is uncomfortable.
FOL: all x. (Hungry(x) -> Uncomfortable(x))

TEXT: If a person is uncomfortable, the person is unhappy.
FOL: all x. (Uncomfortable(x) -> Unhappy(x))

TEXT: If a person is not hungry, the person is unhappy.
FOL: all x. (-Hungry(x) -> Unhappy(x))

In this case, the conclusion doesn't follow directly from the premises. While it is true that being hungry causes discomfort and discomfort causes unhappiness, not being hungry does not necessarily imply unhappiness. There could be other factors that contribute to a person's happiness or unhappiness.
Processed: Uncertain

In order to evaluate whether the conclusion follows from the premises, we need to determine if there is only one person who won the Turing Award and made contributions to the analysis of algorithms. From the given premises, it appears that Donald Knuth is the only one who fits this description. However, without more information, we cannot definitively say that the conclusion follows from the premises. To confirm, we would need to use a theorem prover like Prover9 to prove the implication.

TEXT: Rappers are not opera singers.
FOL: -(exists x. (Rapper(x) & OperaSinger(x)))

TEXT: Well Done 3 is worth listening to.
FOL: WorthListeningTo(WellDone3)

Since there is no explicit connection between the premises and the conclusion, it is impossible to determine whether the conclusion follows from the premises. It is not logical to conclude that a rap album released by a rapper is worth listening to based on the given premises.
Processed: Uncertain

TEXT: Rappers are not opera singers.
FOL: -(all x. (Rapper(x) -> OperaSinger(x)))

TEXT: Well Done 3 is worth listening to.
FOL: WorthListeningTo(WellDone3)

The conclusion does not follow from the premises because the premises do not provide any information about the quality or worth of the Well Done 3 album.
Processed: Uncertain

Generation 3:

TEXT: Rappers are not opera singers.
FOL: all x. (Rapper(x) -> -OperaSinger(x))

TEXT: Well Done 3 is worth listening to.
FOL: WorthListeningTo(WellDone3)

(Since the premises do not provide any information about the quality of the Well Done 3 album, it is not possible to deduce the conclusion from the premises.)
Processed: Uncertain

Generation 4:
TEXT: Tyga is a rapper.
FOL: Rapper(Tyga)
TEXT: Rappers release rap albums.

TEXT: Rappers are not opera singers.
FOL: all x. (Rapper(x) -> -OperaSinger(x))
TEXT: Well Done 3 is worth listening to.
FOL: -(WellDone3(x) -> -WorthListeningTo(x))

In this case, the conclusion does not follow from the premises. The premises tell us that Tyga is a rapper and released the Well Done 3 album, which is a rap album, and that rappers are not opera singers. However, the conclusion states that the album is worth listening to, which is not a logical implication of the given premises. The premises do not provide any information about the quality or merit of the album.
Processed: Uncertain

Generation 5:
TEXT: Tyga is a rapper.
FOL: Rapper(Tyga)

TEXT: Rappers are not opera singers.
FOL: all x. (Rapper(x) -> -OperaSinger(x))

TEXT: Well Done 3 is worth listening to.
FOL: WorthListeningTo(WellDone3)

The conclusion is not logically followable from the premises. The premises only establish that Tyga is a rapper who released the Well Done 3 album, but they do not provide any information about the quality or worthiness of the album. Therefore, it is not valid to conclude that Well Done 3 is worth listening to based on the given premises.

TEXT: Rappers are not opera singers.
FOL: all x. (Rapper(x) -> -OperaSinger(x))

TEXT: Well Done 3 is worth listening to.
FOL: WorthListeningTo(WellDone3)

Since the given premises do not provide any information about the quality or worth of the album, it is not possible to determine whether the conclusion follows from the premises. Therefore, the conclusion does not follow from the premises.
Processed: Uncertain

FOL: all x. (Rapper(x) -> -OperaSinger(x))

TEXT: Well Done 3 is worth listening to.

TEXT: Some birds are hawks.
FOL: exists x. (Bird(x) & Hawk(x))
TEXT: All birds swim.
FOL: all x. Bird(x) -> Swims(x)

The conclusion does not follow from the premises. The premises state that hawks never swim and some birds are hawks, but they do not provide information about all birds.

TEXT: Some birds are hawks.
FOL: exists x. (Bird(x) & Hawk(x))
TEXT: All birds swim.
FOL: all x. Bird(x) -> Swims(x)

This conclusion does not follow from the premises. The premises only state that hawks don't swim and some birds are hawks, but they do not imply that all birds swim.
Processed: Uncertain

Generation 4:
TEXT: A hawk never swims.

TEXT: Some birds are hawks.
FOL: exists x. (Bird(x) & Hawk(x))
TEXT: All birds swim.
FOL: all x. (Bird(x) -> Swims(x))

The given conclusion does not follow from the given premises. The conclusion assumes that all birds swim, but one of the premises states that hawks (which are birds) never swim. Therefore, the conclusion is false.
Processed: False

Generation 5:
TEXT: A hawk never swims.
FOL: all x. (Hawk(x) -> -Swims(x))
TEXT: Some birds are hawks.
FOL: exists x. (Bird(x) & Hawk(x))
TEXT: All birds swim.
FOL: all x. Bird(x) -> Swims(x)

The conclusion does not follow from the premises because the premises state that some hawks do not swim, but they do not state that all birds swim.
Processed: Uncertain

TEXT: A hawk never swims.
FOL: all x. (Hawk(x) -> -Swims(x))
TEXT: Some birds are hawks.
FOL: exists x. (Bird(x) & Hawk(x))

TEXT: Some birds are hawks.
FOL: exists x. (Bird(x) & Hawk(x))

TEXT: All birds swim.
FOL: all x. Bird(x) -> Swims(x)

The conclusion does not follow from the premises. According to the given premises, some birds (hawks) do not swim, so it is not true that all birds swim.

TEXT: Some birds are hawks.
FOL: exists x. (Bird(x) & Hawk(x))
TEXT: All birds swim.
FOL: all x. Bird(x) -> Swims(x)

The conclusion does not follow from the premises. The premises state that a hawk does not swim and some birds are hawks, but they do not imply that all birds swim. The conclusion is a generalization about all birds, but the premises only provide specific information about hawks and some birds. Therefore, the conclusion is not supported by the premises.
Processed: Uncertain

Generation 9:
TEXT: A hawk never swims.

TEXT: John's car is a Tesla Model 3.
FOL: TeslaModel3(JohnCar)

In this case, the conclusion does not follow from the premises. According to the premises, if John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, it cannot be a Tesla Model 3. However, it doesn't say that John's car must be a single-seat electric car if it's not a Tesla Model 3. Therefore, it is not possible to conclude that John's car is a Tesla Model 3.
Processed: Uncertain

Generation 5:
TEXT: If something can transport multiple passengers, then they are not one-seaters.
FOL: all x. (CanTransportMultiplePassengers(x) -> -OneSeater(x))

FOL: (-TeslaModel3(JohnsCar) -> (-TeslaModel3(JohnsCar) & -SingleSeatElectricCar(JohnsCar)))

TEXT: John's car is a Tesla Model 3.
FOL: TeslaModel3(JohnsCar)

In this case, the premises do not allow us to conclude that John's car is a Tesla Model 3. However, if we have additional information that John's car cannot transport multiple passengers or is not a single-seat electric car, we can deduce that John's car is a Tesla Model 3.
Processed: Uncertain

Generation 6:
TEXT: If something can transport multiple passengers, then they are not one-seaters.
FOL: all x. (CanTransportMultiplePassengers(x) -> -OneSeater(x))

FOL: -TeslaModel3(JohnCar) -> (-TeslaModel3(JohnCar) & -SingleSeatElectricCar(JohnCar))
TEXT: John's car is a Tesla Model 3.
FOL: TeslaModel3(JohnCar)

In this case, the conclusion does not follow from the premises. According to the given premises, if John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, it cannot be a Tesla Model 3. However, it doesn't mean that John's car must be a Tesla Model 3. It could be any other car that is not a Tesla Model 3 or a single-seat electric car. Therefore, the conclusion does not follow logically from the premises.
Processed: Uncertain

Generation 7:
TEXT: If something can transport multiple passengers, then they are not one-seaters.

FOL: -TeslaModel3(JohnCar) -> (-TeslaModel3(JohnCar) & -SingleSeatElectricCar(JohnCar))

TEXT: John's car is a Tesla Model 3.
FOL: TeslaModel3(JohnCar)

In this case, the conclusion does not follow from the premises. According to the premises, if John's car is not a Tesla Model 3, then it is not a Tesla Model 3 or a single-seat electric car. However, the premises do not provide any information about what John's car is if it is not a Tesla Model 3. It could be any other type of car, including a single-seat electric car, which would make the conclusion false.
