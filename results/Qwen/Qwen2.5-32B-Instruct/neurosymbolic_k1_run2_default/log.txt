Note: The conclusion's FOL expression indicates the existence of a prehistoric bird genus discovered by Yevgeny Kurochkin. Given the premise that Ambiortus is a prehistoric bird genus and Yevgeny Kurochkin is its discoverer, this conclusion logically follows from the premises. However, the conclusion's phrasing suggests discovery of a new genus, which could be interpreted as the genus being newly discovered in the context of the statement rather than previously unknown in general. This interpretation aligns with the information provided in the premises.

This assumes that there's an understanding in the logical system that Maggie Friedman is the showrunner of Witches of East End, as established in one of the premises. However, for a more precise translation, we could replace `ShowrunnerOf(WitchesOfEastEnd)` directly with `MaggieFriedman` given the context provided by the premises.

FOL: NumberOfDistinctWorks(ChroniclesOfNarnia, 7)
TEXT: The Chronicles of Narnia series of books is not Heptalogy.
FOL: -Heptalogy(ChroniclesOfNarnia)

Note: For clarity and consistency, "Heptalogyy" in the original text was corrected to "Heptalogy". Also, to accurately capture the premises and conclusion in FOL, I've assumed predicates such as `NumberOfDistinctWorks/2` and `Heptalogy/1`, where the first argument represents a series and the second argument for `NumberOfDistinctWorks` denotes the count of distinct works. This representation assumes that `ChroniclesOfNarnia` and `HarryPotterSeries` are treated as singular entities (i.e., entire series). The predicate `LiteraryWork/1` was introduced to define a literary work, although its necessity might depend on the exact logical formulation required by the theorem prover or the context.

Note: For the conclusion to be directly evaluated using the given premises, we need to link the fact that Roversi is an Italian surname to anyone who uses this surname. This can be done implicitly or explicitly depending on how the logic solver handles the translation. Here, I've introduced "ItalianSurnameUsed" as a predicate to represent the conclusion. To make this explicit in FOL, we could add a premise such as:
FOL: all x. all y. (Surname(x, y) & ItalianSurname(y) -> ItalianSurnameUsed(x))
This additional premise would allow us to conclude that Alba Roversi uses an Italian surname based on the premises provided.
