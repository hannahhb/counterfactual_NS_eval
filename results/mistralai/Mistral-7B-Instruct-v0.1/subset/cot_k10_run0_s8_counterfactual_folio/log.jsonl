From premise 4, we know that in La Liga 2021-2022, Real Madrid received more points than Barcelona. Therefore, in La Liga 2021-2022, Real Madrid received more points than Barcelona, so Real Madrid ranks higher than Barcelona, so the statement is true.\nANSWER:\tTrue\n</EVALUATE>\n\n<PREMISES>\nAll professional athletes spend most of their time on sports.\nAll Olympic gold medal winners are professional athletes.\nNo full-time scientists spend the majority of their time on sports.\nAll Nobel physics laureates are full-time scientists.\nAmy spends the most time on sports, or Amy is an Olympic gold medal winner.\nIf Amy is not a Nobel physics laureate, then Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner.\n</PREMISES>\n<CONCLUSION>\nIf Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner, then Amy is a Nobel physics laureate.\n</CONCLUSION>\n<EVALUATE>\n\nLet's think step by step. We want to evaluate the statement \"if Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner, then Amy is a Nobel laureate\". Let's assume that Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner. This doesn't tell us anything about whether Amy is a Nobel laureate, so the statement isn't true, meaning it is either False or Uncertain. To distinguish between the two, notice that we could have a scenario where Amy is neither an Olympic gold medal winner nor a Nobel laureate. None of the premises are violated in this case.

We want to evaluate if James contributes to the country. Let's think about what we know about James. First, we know that James was either sentenced for thief or stayed in prison. However, this doesn't tell us anything about whether James contributed to the country. Second, we know that James either had a bad record in the local state or that he was respected by others. However, the premises don't tell us anything about the relationship between having a bad record and contributing to the country.

We want to evaluate if Inception is a folk song. We know that Inception is a sci-fi movie. Since all movies are videos and Inception is a movie, it is a video, which means it is visual. On the other hand, we know that all folk songs are songs, and no songs are visual, so no folk songs are visual. Therefore, since Inception is visual but no folk songs are visual, we know that Inception cannot be a folk song, so the statement is false.\nANSWER:\tFalse\n</EVALUATE>\n\n<PREMISES>\nEvery chef can cook.\nSome people who aren\u2019t chefs can cook.\nPeople who cook can make scrambled eggs and pasta.\nIf someone can make cookies and muffins, they are a baker.\nBakers who can also make scrambled eggs can make a good breakfast.\nLuke can make cookies, scrambled eggs, and muffins, but not pasta.\n</PREMISES>\n<CONCLUSION>\nLuke is a chef.\n</CONCLUSION>\n<EVALUATE>\n\nLet's think step by step.
