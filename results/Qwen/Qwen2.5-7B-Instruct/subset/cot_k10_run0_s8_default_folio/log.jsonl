We want to evaluate if a worksheet is not dispensable. From premise 6, we know that a worksheet is either paper or is environment-friendly. If it is paper, then from premise 3, a worksheet is woodware, and from premise 2, a worksheet is dispensable. If it is environment-friendly, we know it is good from premise 5, but we know nothing about whether it is dispensable. Therefore, we don't know if a worksheet is dispensible or not, so the statement is uncertain.\nANSWER:\tUncertain\n</EVALUATE>\n\n<PREMISES>\nA La Liga soccer team ranks higher than another La Liga soccer team if it receives more points.\nIf there are two La Liga soccer teams and neither has more points than the other, then the team which receives more points from the games between the two teams ranks higher.\nReal Madrid and Barcelona are both La Liga soccer teams.\nReal Madrid received more points than Barcelona.\nNeither Real Madrid nor Barcelona received more points from the games between them.\n</PREMISES>\n<CONCLUSION>\nReal Madrid ranks higher than Barcelona.\n</CONCLUSION>\n<EVALUATE>\n\nLet's think step by step. We want to evaluate if in La Liga 2021-2022, Real Madrid ranks higher than Barcelona. From premise 1, we know that a La Liga soccer team ranks higher than another if it receives more points. From premise 4, we know that in La Liga 2021-2022, Real Madrid received more points than Barcelona. Therefore, in La Liga 2021-2022, Real Madrid received more points than Barcelona, so Real Madrid ranks higher than Barcelona, so the statement is true.\nANSWER:\tTrue\n</EVALUATE>\n\n<PREMISES>\nAll professional athletes spend most of their time on sports.\nAll Olympic gold medal winners are professional athletes.\nNo full-time scientists spend the majority of their time on sports.\nAll Nobel physics laureates are full-time scientists.\nAmy spends the most time on sports, or Amy is an Olympic gold medal winner.\nIf Amy is not a Nobel physics laureate, then Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner.\n</PREMISES>\n<CONCLUSION>\nIf Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner, then Amy is a Nobel physics laureate.\n</CONCLUSION>\n<EVALUATE>\n\nLet's think step by step. We want to evaluate the statement \"if Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner, then Amy is a Nobel laureate\". Let's assume that Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner. This doesn't tell us anything about whether Amy is a Nobel laureate, so the statement isn't true, meaning it is either False or Uncertain. To distinguish between the two, notice that we could have a scenario where Amy is neither an Olympic gold medal winner nor a Nobel laureate. None of the premises are violated in this case.

We want to evaluate if James contributes to the country. Let's think about what we know about James. First, we know that James was either sentenced for thief or stayed in prison. However, this doesn't tell us anything about whether James contributed to the country. Second, we know that James either had a bad record in the local state or that he was respected by others. However, the premises don't tell us anything about the relationship between having a bad record and contributing to the country. Therefore, it is uncertain whether James contributes to the country.\nANSWER:\tUncertain\n</EVALUATE>\n\n<PREMISES>\nNo songs are visuals.\nAll folk songs are songs.\nAll videos are visuals.\nAll movies are videos.\nAll sci-fi movies are movies.\nInception is a sci-fi movie.\nMac is neither a folk song nor a sci-fi movie.\n</PREMISES>\n<CONCLUSION>\nInception is a folk song.\n</CONCLUSION>\n<EVALUATE>\n\nLet's think step by step. We want to evaluate if Inception is a folk song. We know that Inception is a sci-fi movie. Since all movies are videos and Inception is a movie, it is a video, which means it is visual. On the other hand, we know that all folk songs are songs, and no songs are visual, so no folk songs are visual. Therefore, since Inception is visual but no folk songs are visual, we know that Inception cannot be a folk song, so the statement is false.\nANSWER:\tFalse\n</EVALUATE>\n\n<PREMISES>\nEvery chef can cook.\nSome people who aren\u2019t chefs can cook.\nPeople who cook can make scrambled eggs and pasta.\nIf someone can make cookies and muffins, they are a baker.\nBakers who can also make scrambled eggs can make a good breakfast.\nLuke can make cookies, scrambled eggs, and muffins, but not pasta.\n</PREMISES>\n<CONCLUSION>\nLuke is a chef.\n</CONCLUSION>\n<EVALUATE>\n\nLet's think step by step.

Therefore, grebes cannot be mammals.\n\n4. **Classification of Grebes**: Since grebes do not lay eggs, they cannot be mammals. Furthermore, the premises state that all animals are either vertebrates or invertebrates, and all mammals are animals. Grebes are not mammals and are not invertebrates (since they are vertebrates), and they do not fit the criteria of laying eggs as per the mammals that do so.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"Grebes are not mammals\" is correct.\n\nANSWER:\tTrue\n", "Let's think step by step.

Grebes are not platypuses and also not echidnas.\n\nFrom premise 8, Grebes lay eggs. Premises 1 and 9 tell us that since Grebes lay eggs, they must be either platypuses or echidnas. However, premise 9 explicitly states that Grebes are neither platypuses nor echidnas. Therefore, the only way this can be consistent is if Grebes are not mammals.
