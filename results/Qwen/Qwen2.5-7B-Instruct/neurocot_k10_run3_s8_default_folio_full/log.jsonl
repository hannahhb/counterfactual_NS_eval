From the first premise, we know that scheduling a meeting with customers leads to appearing in the company today.\n2. From the second premise, having lunch in the company means scheduling meetings with customers.\n3. From the third premise, we know that James can either have lunch in the company or at home.\n\nLet's analyze the final condition about James:\n- If James is a manager and appears in the company today, he cannot be working remotely from home (premise 5), and since no managers work remotely from home, this scenario is possible.\n- If James is not a manager and does not appear in the company today, he would not be required to schedule a meeting with customers to have lunch in the company (premise 2), and he could have lunch at home (premise 3).\n\nGiven that James is either in one of the two scenarios mentioned, we need to see if the conditions lead to him having lunch in the company.\n\nSince the scenario where James is not a manager and does not appear in the company today allows for the possibility of having lunch at home (premise 3), the only way to ensure James does not have lunch at home is if he has lunch in the company.\n\nTherefore, based on the premises provided, we can conclude:\nFOL: HasLunchInCompany(James)\nTEXT: James has lunch in the company.\nFOL: HasLunchInCompany(James)", "TEXT: All employees who schedule a meeting with their customers will appear in the company today.\nREASONING: If an employee schedules a meeting with their customers, they will appear in the company today.\nFOL: all x.

From the premise \"If an employee has lunch in the company, then they schedule meetings with customers,\" and knowing that everyone who schedules a meeting with customers will appear in the company today, we can infer that if James has lunch in the company, he will appear in the company today.\n\n2. From \"James is either a manager and appears in the company today, or he is not a manager and does not appear in the company today,\" and the fact that no manager works remotely from home, we can deduce that if James is a manager, he must appear in the company today because managers do not work remotely and must appear in the company if they have lunch there.\n\n3. Since James is not a manager and does not appear in the company today, it means he does not have lunch in the company because having lunch in the company would require him to schedule a meeting, and since he does not appear in the company today, he cannot have lunch in the company.\n\nTherefore, based on the logical structure and the given premises, James must have lunch at home, and this is consistent with the condition that if an employee has lunch at home, they work remotely from home. Since James is not a manager and does not appear in the company today, he cannot have lunch in the company.\n\nFOL: -HasLunchInCompany(James)"], "answers": ["Uncertain", "Uncertain", "True", "True", "True", "True", "True", "True", "True", "Uncertain"], "reference": "Uncertain", "time_total": 193.024751663208, "time_llm": 171.6433460712433, "prompt_length": 17407}

Let's break down the conditions:\n\n1. If James has lunch in the company, he must schedule a meeting (Premise 2).\n2. If he schedules a meeting, he will appear in the company today (Premise 1).\n3. If James appears in the company today, he can't be a manager (from the final premise).\n\nLet's analyze the situation:\n- Assume \\( \\text{LunchInCompany}(James) \\). Then by Premise 2, \\( \\text{SchedulesMeeting}(James) \\).\n- By Premise 1, since he schedules a meeting, he will appear in the company today (\\( \\text{AppearsToday}(James) \\)).\n- Given the final premise, if James appears in the company today, he cannot be a manager. But the final premise also says that if James is a manager, he will appear in the company today.\n\nTherefore, James cannot be a manager and appear in the company today at the same time.

Let's consider the possible scenarios:\n\n1. If Djokovic is an Oscar-nominated actor:\n   - He is a celebrity (from premise 3).\n   - He is well paid (from premise 5).\n   - He is famous (from premise 7).\n   - He is an athlete (from premise 6).\n   - Therefore, he lives in a tax haven (from premise 9).\n   \n2.

To prove Djokovic is a Grand Slam champion, additional information is needed about his status as an athlete and whether he is famous. Without such information, we cannot definitively conclude that Djokovic is a Grand Slam champion based solely on the given premises.\n\nFOL: GrandSlamChampion(Djokovic)", "TEXT: A person is either a Grand Slam champion or an Oscar-nominated actor.\nREASONING: This establishes that every person falls into one of two categories: Grand Slam champion or Oscar-nominated actor.\nFOL: all x.

Since all well-paid people live in tax havens, and Djokovic can either be a Grand Slam champion or an Oscar-nominated actor, it would imply that Djokovic lives in a tax haven if he fits into either category.

However, the conclusion states that Djokovic does not live in a tax haven. Therefore, Djokovic cannot be both famous and an athlete. Given that he is either a Grand Slam champion or an Oscar-nominated actor, we need to show that he cannot be a famous athlete.
