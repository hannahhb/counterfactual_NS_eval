Since there is at least one bear in a zoo (from `premise2`), this means there is at least one bear that is not wild. Therefore, the statement \"not all bears are wild\" must be true.\n\nThis confirms that the conclusion does follow from the premises.\n\nThe output from the theorem solver should confirm that the conclusion logically follows from the premises.

If the system finds a contradiction, it would indicate that the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nHowever, since we are not actually running the theorem prover here, let's reason through the logical steps:\n\n1. From `all x. (ZooBear(x) -> -Wild(x))`, we know that all bears in zoos are not wild.\n2. From `exists x. (Bear(x) & ZooBear(x))`, we know that there is at least one bear that is in a zoo.\n3. Combining these two, we know there is at least one bear (let's call it `b`) such that `ZooBear(b)` is true, and therefore `Wild(b)` must be false.\n4. This means that there is at least one bear that is not wild.\n5. Therefore, it is not true that all bears are wild (`~forall x.

To evaluate this, we need to consider if Ambiortus being a known genus means it is not \"new.\"\n\nGiven the information:\n- Ambiortus is a known genus, and Kurochkin discovered Ambiortus. This does not imply that Ambiortus is a new genus; rather, it implies Kurochkin discovered a known genus.\n\nThus, the conclusion `Yevgeny Kurochkin discovered a new bird genus` does not logically follow from the premises because Ambiortus is already known to be a genus.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is **not** supported by the premises.", "TEXT: Ambiortus is a prehistoric bird genus.\nFOL: Genus(Ambiortus)\n\nTEXT: Ambiortus Dementjevi is the only known species of Ambiortus.\nFOL: Species(Dementjevi, Ambiortus) & all x.

Since we don't have a direct way to express \"new\" in the premises, we can assume that the discovery of Ambiortus implies the discovery of a new genus.

From the premise \"Pierre de Rigaud de Vaudreuil built Fort Carillon,\" we know that Pierre de Rigaud de Vaudreuil built Fort Carillon.\n2. From the premise \"Fort Carillon was located in New France,\" we know that Fort Carillon is located in New France.\n3. Combining these two pieces of information, we can conclude that Pierre de Rigaud de Vaudreuil built a fort (specifically Fort Carillon) that is located in New France.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"Pierre de Rigaud de Vaudreuil built a fort in New France\" logically follows from the premises.\n\nHere is the final evaluation:\n```\nTEXT: Fort Ticonderoga is the current name for Fort Carillon.\nFOL: CurrentName(FortTiconderoga, FortCarillon)\n\nTEXT: Pierre de Rigaud de Vaudreuil built Fort Carillon.\nFOL: BuiltBy(PierreDeRigaudDeVaudreuil, FortCarillon)\n\nTEXT: Fort Carillon was located in New France.\nFOL: LocatedIn(FortCarillon, NewFrance)\n\nTEXT: New France is not in Europe.\nFOL: -LocatedIn(NewFrance, Europe)\n\nTEXT: Pierre de Rigaud de Vaudreuil built a fort in New France.\nFOL: (BuiltBy(PierreDeRigaudDeVaudreuil, x) & LocatedIn(x, NewFrance))\n```", "TEXT: Fort Ticonderoga is the current name for Fort Carillon.\nFOL: CurrentName(FortTiconderoga, FortCarillon)\n\nTEXT: Pierre de Rigaud de Vaudreuil built Fort Carillon.\nFOL: BuiltBy(PierreDeRigaudDeVaudreuil, FortCarillon)\n\nTEXT: Fort Carillon was located in New France.\nFOL: LocatedIn(FortCarillon, NewFrance)\n\nTEXT: New France is not in Europe.\nFOL: -LocatedIn(NewFrance, Europe)\n\nTEXT: Pierre de Rigaud de Vaudreuil built a fort in New France.\nFOL: BuiltBy(PierreDeRigaudDeVaudreuil, FortInNewFrance)\n\nTEXT: FortCarillon and FortInNewFrance are the same fort.\nFOL: (LocatedIn(FortCarillon, NewFrance) -> (FortInNewFrance = FortCarillon))\n\nTEXT: Pierre de Rigaud de Vaudreuil built FortCarillon in New France.\nFOL: (BuiltBy(PierreDeRigaudDeVaudreuil, FortCarillon) & LocatedIn(FortCarillon, NewFrance) -> BuiltBy(PierreDeRigaudDeVaudreuil, FortInNewFrance))\n\nTEXT: Therefore, Pierre de Rigaud de Vaudreuil built a fort in New France.\nFOL: BuiltBy(PierreDeRigaudDeVaudreuil, FortInNewFrance)", "TEXT: Fort Ticonderoga is the current name for Fort Carillon.\nFOL: CurrentName(FortTiconderoga, FortCarillon)\n\nTEXT: Pierre de Rigaud de Vaudreuil built Fort Carillon.\nFOL: BuiltBy(PierreDeRigaudDeVaudreuil, FortCarillon)\n\nTEXT: Fort Carillon was located in New France.\nFOL: LocatedIn(FortCarillon, NewFrance)\n\nTEXT: New France is not in Europe.\nFOL: -LocatedIn(NewFrance, Europe)\n\nTEXT: Pierre de Rigaud de Vaudreuil built a fort in New France.\nFOL: Exists x.

However, let's analyze the logical structure:\n\n1. The premise \"All iPhones are electronic\" means every iPhone is electronic.\n2. The premise \"Some phones are iPhones\" means there exists at least one phone that is an iPhone.\n\nGiven these premises, we know that there must be at least one phone (an iPhone) that is electronic. Therefore, the statement \"No phones are electronic\" contradicts the premises.

From the premise \"Some phones are iPhones\":\n   - There exists at least one phone that is an iPhone.\n   - `exists x. (Phone(x) & iPhone(x))`\n\n3. The conclusion \"No phones are electronic\" states:\n   - For all phones, if something is a phone, then it is not electronic.\n   - `all x.

(RealNumber(x) & RealNumber(y) & x = y + 1 -> Larger(x, y))`\n\n3. **If the number \\( x \\) is larger than the number \\( y \\), then \\( y \\) is not larger than \\( x \\).**\n   - FOL: `all x. all y. (Larger(x, y) -> -Larger(y, x))`\n\n4. **Seven equals six plus one.**\n   - FOL: `7 = 6 + 1`\n\n5. **Eight equals seven plus one.**\n   - FOL: `8 = 7 + 1`\n\n6. **Two is positive.**\n   - FOL: `Positive(2)`\n\n7. **If a number is positive, then the double of it is also positive.**\n   - FOL: `all x. (Positive(x) -> Positive(Double(x)))`\n\n8. **Eight is the double of four.**\n   - FOL: `8 = Double(4)`\n\n9. **Four is the double of two.**\n   - FOL: `4 = Double(2)`\n\n### Conclusion\n\n1. **Eight is positive.**\n   - FOL: `Positive(8)`\n\n### Evaluation\n\n```python\nfrom nltk import *\n\n# Define the predicates\nRealNumber = Predicate('RealNumber')\nLarger = Predicate('Larger')\nPositive = Predicate('Positive')\nDouble = Function('Double')\n\n# Define the axioms\naxiom1 = all_x(implies(Equals(x, 6), RealNumber(x))) & \\\n         all_x(implies(Equals(x, 7), RealNumber(x))) & \\\n         all_x(implies(Equals(x, 8), RealNumber(x)))\n\naxiom2 = all_x(all_y_all_z(implies(and_(RealNumber(x), RealNumber(y), Equals(x, Plus(y, 1))), Larger(x, y))))\n\naxiom3 = all_x_all_y(implies(Larger(x, y), not_(Larger(y, x))))\n\naxiom4 = Equals(7, Plus(6, 1))\n\naxiom5 = Equals(8, Plus(7, 1))\n\naxiom6 = Positive(2)\n\naxiom7 = all_x(implies(Positive(x), Positive(Double(x))))\n\naxiom8 = Equals(8, Double(4))\n\naxiom9 = Equals(4, Double(2))\n\n# Define the goal\ngoal = Positive(8)\n\n# Combine all axioms and the goal\nformulas = [axiom1, axiom2, axiom3, axiom4, axiom5, axiom6, axiom7, axiom8, axiom9, goal]\n\n# Print the formulas\nprint(\"Formulas:\")\nfor formula in formulas:\n    print(formula)\n```\n\nThis setup will allow you to evaluate whether the conclusion follows from the premises using a theorem prover like Prover9. The above code uses the NLTK package to define the predicates and logical expressions in the correct format.", "Let's translate the given premises and conclusion into first-order logic (FOL) expressions using the format adhering to the Python NLTK package logic module.\n\n### PREMISES\n\n1. **Six, seven and eight are real numbers.**\n   - FOL: `RealNumber(6) & RealNumber(7) & RealNumber(8)`\n\n2. **If a real number equals another real number added by one, the first number is larger.**\n   - FOL: `all x. all y.

Assume the premises are true.\n2. From Premise 1: Every artificial satellite is an important scientific achievement.\n3. From Premise 2: There is at least one artificial satellite that is not a U.S. invention.\n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion:\n- Suppose there exists an important scientific achievement that is not a U.S. invention. According to Premise 1, this achievement would have to be an artificial satellite.\n- However, according to Premise 2, there is no artificial satellite that is not a U.S. invention.\n\nThis contradiction shows that the assumption \"there exists an important scientific achievement that is not a U.S. invention\" cannot hold true under the given premises.\n\nTherefore, the only way to avoid this contradiction is if every important scientific achievement is indeed a U.S. invention. Hence, the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe conclusion \"All important scientific achievements are U.S. inventions\" does follow from the given premises.\n\nThus, the evaluation confirms that the conclusion is valid based on the premises provided.", "TEXT: All artificial satellites are important scientific achievements.\nFOL: all x.

From the premise \"All cats are mammals,\" we know every cat is also a mammal.\n\nCombining these two premises, we can infer that there exists a mammal (which is a cat) that is not a pet. This directly supports the conclusion \"Some mammals are not pets.\"\n\nHere's how you can represent this in FOL and evaluate it:\n\n```python\nfrom nltk import Expression\n\n# Define predicates\nCat = Expression('Cat')\nPet = Expression('Pet')\nMammal = Expression('Mammal')\n\n# Premises\npremise1 = Expression('&', Expression('exists', Cat), Expression('&', Cat, Expression('-', Pet)))\npremise2 = Expression('all', Cat, Expression('->', Cat, Mammal))\n\n# Conclusion\nconclusion = Expression('exists', Mammal, Expression('&', Mammal, Expression('-', Pet)))\n\n# Convert to strings for evaluation\npremise1_str = str(premise1)\npremise2_str = str(premise2)\nconclusion_str = str(conclusion)\n\nprint(f\"PREMISE 1: {premise1_str}\")\nprint(f\"PREMISE 2: {premise2_str}\")\nprint(f\"CONCLUSION: {conclusion_str}\")\n```\n\nWhen evaluated, the conclusion should logically follow from the premises based on the logical relationships defined.

(Mammal(x) & ~Pet(x))\n\nWe need to prove that the third statement follows from the first two. Let's use the rules of inference:\n\n- From the second premise, we know that if something is a cat, then it is a mammal. Formally:\n  \\( \\forall x. (\\text{Cat}(x) \\rightarrow \\text{Mammal}(x)) \\)\n\n- From the first premise, there exists at least one cat that is not a pet. Formally:\n  \\( \\exists x.

Therefore:\n\\[ \\text{Cat}(c) \\rightarrow \\text{Mammal}(c) \\]\n\nGiven \\( \\text{Cat}(c) \\), we can infer:\n\\[ \\text{Mammal}(c) \\]\n\nSince \\( \\neg \\text{Pet}(c) \\) and \\( \\text{Mammal}(c) \\), we have:\n\\[ \\exists x.

(Cat(x) -> Mammal(x))` - Every cat is a mammal.\n\nTo conclude that `exists x. (Mammal(x) & ~Pet(x))`, we need to show that there exists at least one mammal that is not a pet. Given that:\n- There is a cat (let's call it `c`) that is not a pet (`~Pet(c)`).\n- Since `c` is a cat, and all cats are mammals (`Mammal(c)`).\n\nTherefore, `c` is a mammal that is not a pet. This satisfies the conclusion `exists x. (Mammal(x) & ~Pet(x))`.\n\nLet's write this in the format expected by Prover9:\n\n```python\nfrom nltk import *\n\n# Define the predicates\nCat = Predicate('Cat')\nPet = Predicate('Pet')\nMammal = Predicate('Mammal')\n\n# Premises\npremise1 = Exists([x], And(Cat(x), Not(Pet(x))))\npremise2 = Forall([x], Implies(Cat(x), Mammal(x)))\n\n# Conclusion\nconclusion = Exists([x], And(Mammal(x), Not(Pet(x))))\n\n# Combine all formulas\nformula = And(premise1, premise2, Not(conclusion))\n\n# Print the formula in FOL\nprint(formula)\n```\n\nWhen we run this through a theorem prover like Prover9, it should confirm that the conclusion logically follows from the premises.

(Mammal(x) & -Pet(x))\n\nThe next step would be to evaluate whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises using a theorem prover. Let's break down the logic:\n\n1. From the premise \"Some cats are not pets,\" we know there exists at least one cat that is not a pet.\n2. From the premise \"All cats are mammals,\" we know that if something is a cat, then it must be a mammal.\n\nCombining these two premises, we can infer that there exists at least one mammal (specifically a cat) that is not a pet. Therefore, the conclusion \"Some mammals are not pets\" logically follows from the premises.\n\nTo evaluate this formally, we can use a theorem prover like Prover9. Here's how the input would look:\n\n```python\nfrom nltk import Prov\n\n# Define predicates\nCat = Prov('Cat')\nPet = Prov('Pet')\nMammal = Prov('Mammal')\n\n# Premises\npremise1 = Prov.exists(Cat(x), Prov.and_(Cat(x), Prov.not_(Pet(x))))\npremise2 = Prov.all(Cat(x), Mammal(x))\n\n# Conclusion\nconclusion = Prov.exists(Mammal(x), Prov.and_(Mammal(x), Prov.not_(Pet(x))))\n\n# Use Prover9 to check if the conclusion follows from the premises\n# Note: This is a conceptual representation. The actual command would depend on the specific interface used to interact with Prover9.\n```\n\nIn practice, you would use a tool or script to input these expressions into Prover9 and check if the conclusion is derivable from the premises. Given the logical structure, the conclusion should indeed follow from the premises, as shown by the chain of reasoning above.", "TEXT: Some cats are not pets.\nFOL: exists x. (Cat(x) & -Pet(x))\n\nTEXT: All cats are mammals.\nFOL: all x. (Cat(x) -> Mammal(x))\n\nTEXT: Some mammals are not pets.\nFOL: exists x. (Mammal(x) & -Pet(x))\n\nThis evaluation correctly translates the premises and conclusion into First-Order Logic (FOL) using the Python NLTK package logic module format. The premise \"Some cats are not pets\" is expressed as the existence of an individual that is a cat and not a pet. The premise \"All cats are mammals\" states that every cat is a mammal. The conclusion \"Some mammals are not pets\" is expressed as the existence of a mammal that is not a pet.\n\nTo determine if the conclusion follows from the premises, we can input these expressions into a theorem prover like Prover9 and check if the conclusion is derivable from the premises. Here's how you can structure the input for Prover9:\n\n```\n% Premises\nall x. (Cat(x) -> Mammal(x))\nexists x. (Cat(x) & -Pet(x))\n\n% Conclusion\nexists x. (Mammal(x) & -Pet(x))\n```\n\nRunning this input through Prover9 would help determine if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. Based on the logical structure, the conclusion should follow because if there are some cats that are not pets and all cats are mammals, then it must be true that some mammals are not pets.", "TEXT: Some cats are not pets.\nFOL: exists x.

(Mammal(x) & -Pet(x))\n\nThe next step is to evaluate whether the conclusion follows from the premises using a theorem prover like Prover9. Here's how you would set up the input for Prover9:\n\n```prolog\n% Premises\nall x. (Cat(x) -> Mammal(x))\nexists x. (Cat(x) & -Pet(x))\n\n% Conclusion\nexists x. (Mammal(x) & -Pet(x))\n```\n\nNow, you can use Prover9 to check if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. The input file for Prover9 would look like this:\n\n```prolog\nformulas(clauses).\n    all(x, Cat(x) -> Mammal(x)).\n    exist(x, Cat(x) & -Pet(x)).\nend_of_list.\n\nformulas(goals).\n    exist(x, Mammal(x) & -Pet(x)).\nend_of_list.\n```\n\nWhen you run Prover9 with this input, it should confirm that the conclusion follows from the premises. Let's break down the reasoning:\n\n1. From `all x. (Cat(x) -> Mammal(x))`, we know that every cat is a mammal.\n2. From `exists x. (Cat(x) & -Pet(x))`, we know there exists at least one cat that is not a pet.\n\nSince we know that every cat is a mammal, and there is at least one cat that is not a pet, it logically follows that there is at least one mammal (specifically, the non-pet cat) that is not a pet. Therefore, the conclusion `exists x. (Mammal(x) & -Pet(x))` is valid.", "TEXT: Some cats are not pets.\nFOL: exists x. (Cat(x) & -Pet(x))\n\nTEXT: All cats are mammals.\nFOL: all x.

(Mammal(x) & -Pet(x))\n\nWe need to evaluate whether the conclusion \"exists x. (Mammal(x) & -Pet(x))\" logically follows from the premises.\n\nHere is how we can evaluate this using the provided information:\n\n1. From the premise \"all x. (Cat(x) -> Mammal(x))\", we know that if something is a cat, it must be a mammal.\n2. From the premise \"exists x. (Cat(x) & -Pet(x))\", we know that there exists at least one cat that is not a pet.\n\nSince we know that all cats are mammals, if there is a cat that is not a pet, then that cat is also a mammal that is not a pet.

(Mammal(x) & -Pet(x))\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Premise 1:** \"Some cats are not pets.\"\n   - This is translated to `exists x. (Cat(x) & -Pet(x))`, meaning there exists at least one cat that is not a pet.\n\n2. **Premise 2:** \"All cats are mammals.\"\n   - This is translated to `all x. (Cat(x) -> Mammal(x))`, meaning every cat is a mammal.\n\n3. **Conclusion:** \"Some mammals are not pets.\"\n   - We need to show that there exists a mammal that is not a pet. Given that all cats are mammals and some cats are not pets, it logically follows that some mammals (specifically the ones that are cats) are not pets.\n\nUsing these FOL expressions, you can input them into a theorem prover like Prover9 to verify if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\n### Verification:\nTo verify this, you would use a theorem prover to check if the conclusion follows from the premises. Here\u2019s how you might structure it:\n\n```python\nfrom nltk import expr\n\n# Define the logic expressions\npremise1 = expr.Exists('x', expr.And(expr.Symbol('Cat(x)'), expr.Symbol('-Pet(x)')))\npremise2 = expr.Forall('x', expr.Implies(expr.Symbol('Cat(x)'), expr.Symbol('Mammal(x)')))\nconclusion = expr.Exists('x', expr.And(expr.Symbol('Mammal(x)'), expr.Symbol('-Pet(x)')))\n\n# Use a theorem prover to check if the conclusion follows from the premises\n# This step would typically be done using a tool like Prover9 or a similar automated reasoning system\n# The following is a placeholder for the actual command or function call to the theorem prover\nis_valid = prover9.check_validity(premise1, premise2, conclusion)\n\nprint(is_valid)  # Should return True if the conclusion follows from the premises\n```\n\nIn this setup, `prover9.check_validity` would be a hypothetical function that interfaces with a theorem prover to check the validity of the logical implication.", "TEXT: Some cats are not pets.\nFOL: exists x. (Cat(x) & ~Pet(x))\n\nTEXT: All cats are mammals.\nFOL: all x. (Cat(x) -> Mammal(x))\n\nTEXT: Some mammals are not pets.\nFOL: exists x. (Mammal(x) & ~Pet(x))\n\nTo determine whether the conclusion \"Some mammals are not pets\" follows from the premises using a theorem solver like Prover9, we need to ensure that the FOL expressions are correctly formulated and then input them into the solver. Here is the complete set of FOL expressions:\n\n```python\nfrom nltk import Formula\n\n# Premises\npremise1 = Formula(\"exists x. (Cat(x) & ~Pet(x))\")\npremise2 = Formula(\"all x. (Cat(x) -> Mammal(x))\")\n\n# Conclusion\nconclusion = Formula(\"exists x. (Mammal(x) & ~Pet(x))\")\n```\n\nNow, you can use these expressions to evaluate the logical relationship between the premises and the conclusion using Prover9 or a similar automated theorem prover.\n\n### Using Prover9\n\n1. **Prepare the input file** for Prover9:\n   ```plaintext\n   % Premises\n   formula_list(fof(premise1, axiom, exists x.

(Mammal(x) & ~Pet(x)))). % Some mammals are not pets\n\n   % End of input\n   ```\n\n2. **Run Prover9** with this input file. If the conclusion follows from the premises, Prover9 should be able to derive the conclusion from the premises.\n\n### Evaluation via Automated Theorem Proving\n\nSince the conclusion \"Some mammals are not pets\" does logically follow from the premises, Prover9 should confirm this. The reasoning is as follows:\n\n- From `premise1`, we know there is at least one cat that is not a pet.\n- From `premise2`, since all cats are mammals, the cat that is not a pet must also be a mammal.\n- Therefore, there is at least one mammal that is not a pet.\n\nHence, the conclusion \"Some mammals are not pets\" is valid based on the given premises."], "answers": ["True", "Error", "Error", "True", "True", "True", "True", "True", "True", "Error"], "reference": "True", "time_total": 59.16830325126648, "time_llm": 59.133737087249756, "prompt_length": 11239}

From the premise \"GUI(TOra)\", we know TOra is a GUI.\n2. Since \"GUIs are software\", we can infer \"Software(TOra)\".\n3. Since \"Software can be free or paid\", we can write \"FreeOrPaid(TOra)\".\n4. The premise \"Paid Software is not under the GNU General Public License\" tells us that if software is paid, it does not have the GNU General Public License. However, we do not know if TOra is paid or free; we only know it has the GNU General Public License.\n5. The premise \"TOra is under the GNU General Public License\" gives us \"GNUGeneralPublicLicense(TOra)\".\n\nGiven these facts, we need to determine if \"Free(TOra)\" logically follows. \n\nSince TOra is under the GNU General Public License, and we know that:\n- If something is paid, it cannot have the GNU General Public License.\n- TOra has the GNU General Public License.\n\nTherefore, TOra must be free software because if it were paid, it would not have the GNU General Public License, but since it does have the GNU General Public License, it must be free.\n\nThus, the conclusion \"TOra is a free software\" (FOL: Free(TOra)) follows logically from the premises.\n\nHere is the final evaluation:\n\nTEXT: TOra is a GUI.\nFOL: GUI(TOra)\n\nTEXT: GUIs are software.\nFOL: all x.

From the first premise, we know:\n   - `CivilParish(AinderbyQuernhow)` (Ainderby Quernhow is a civil parish)\n   - `LocatedIn(AinderbyQuernhow, HambletonDistrict)` (Ainderby Quernhow is in Hambleton District)\n\n2.

From the third premise:\n   - `LocatedIn(NorthYorkshire, England)` (North Yorkshire is in England)\n\n4. Using the transitive property (the fourth premise):\n   - `LocatedIn(AinderbyQuernhow, NorthYorkshire)` (By transitivity, Ainderby Quernhow is in North Yorkshire)\n   - `LocatedIn(AinderbyQuernhow, England)` (By transitivity, Ainderby Quernhow is in England)\n\n5. Since Ainderby Quernhow is a civil parish and is located in England, we have:\n   - `CivilParish(AinderbyQuernhow) & LocatedIn(AinderbyQuernhow, England)`\n\nThis contradicts the conclusion that \"There is no civil parish in England.\"\n\n### Conclusion\nThe conclusion \"There is no civil parish in England\" does **not** logically follow from the premises. The premises establish that there is at least one civil parish (Ainderby Quernhow) in England.\n\nThus, the conclusion is false based on the given premises.", "Let's break down the premises and the conclusion using First-Order Logic (FOL) expressions, adhering to the format specified.\n\n### Premises:\n1. **Ainderby Quernhow is a village and civil parish in the Hambleton District.**\n   - FOL: `AinderbyQuernhowIsVillageAndParish() & HambletonDistrict()`\n   - Note: We need to introduce predicates for village, civil parish, and district to capture this information.\n2. **Hambleton District is in North Yorkshire.**\n   - FOL: `HambletonDistrictIsInNorthYorkshire()`\n3. **North Yorkshire is in England.**\n   - FOL: `NorthYorkshireIsInEngland()`\n4. **If place A is located in place B and place B is located in place C, then place A is located in place C.**\n   - FOL: `all x. all y. all z.

The correct FOL expression for the conclusion is:\n\n**FOL: `-exists x.

From Premise 1 (`Depressing(x) -> Sad(x)`), we know that anything that is depressing is also sad.\n2.

Therefore, by transitivity, the end of a relationship must also be sad.\n\nHowever, the conclusion states that \"The end of a relationship is invigorating.\" Invigorating means energizing, refreshing, or stimulating. This is contradictory to being sad because being sad implies a negative emotional state, whereas being invigorated implies a positive emotional state.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe conclusion does not follow from the premises.

Now, let\u2019s evaluate whether the conclusion follows from the premises using a theorem prover like Prover9. However, Prover9 requires a specific input format, typically a `.thy` file or a specific command-line format. We can use tools like `prover9` or `spass` to solve this problem if you have access to such tools.\n\nGiven the premises and the conclusion, we need to check if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. To do this programmatically with a tool like Prover9, you would typically write a `.thy` file and run the prover on it. Here's a simplified way to demonstrate the logical structure:\n\n### Simplified Prover9 Input Example:\n```prolog\n% Premises\nall x (China(x) -> (BRICS(x) & EmergingEconomy(x)))\nall x (From(x, China) -> BRICS(x))\nall x (India(x) -> (BRICS(x) & EmergingEconomy(x)))\nall x (From(x, India) -> BRICS(x))\nall x (From(x, China) -> Chinese(x))\nall x (From(x, India) -> Indian(x))\nexists x (From(x, India))\n\n% Conclusion\nnot (all x (BRICS(x) -> -Indian(x)))\n```\n\nRunning this input through Prover9 would check if the conclusion is derivable from the premises. If it finds a proof, it means the conclusion logically follows; otherwise, it would indicate the conclusion does not follow from the premises.\n\nIn this case, the conclusion \"No people from BRICS are Indian people\" does not logically follow from the premises because there is no contradiction or necessary implication that would force this conclusion. The existence of an Indian person does not imply anything about people from other BRICS countries. Therefore, the conclusion is not derivable from the premises.", "Let's translate the premises and the conclusion into FOL expressions using the format of the Python NLTK package logic module.\n\n### Premises:\n1. **China is one of the BRICS, and its economy is emerging.**\n   - FOL: `all x.

Given the premises, it is clear that we cannot derive the negation of `EmergingEconomy(India)` because the premises affirm that India is one of the BRICS and its economy is emerging. Therefore, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe conclusion \"India's economy is not emerging\" does not follow from the given premises.", "This problem seems to be a bit contradictory because the premises establish that India is one of the BRICS and its economy is emerging. The conclusion, however, states that India's economy is not emerging, which directly contradicts the given premise. Let's formalize the premises and see if we can use a theorem solver like Prover9 to check the validity of the conclusion.\n\n### Formalization\n\n**Premises:**\n1. **China is one of the BRICS, and its economy is emerging.**\n   - FOL: `BRICS(China) & EmergingEconomy(China)`\n2. **If someone is from China, then they are from a country of BRICS.**\n   - FOL: `all x. (From(x, China) -> BRICS(x))`\n3. **India is one of the BRICS, and its economy is emerging.**\n   - FOL: `BRICS(India) & EmergingEconomy(India)`\n4. **If someone is from India, then they are in a country of BRICS.**\n   - FOL: `all x. (From(x, India) -> BRICS(x))`\n5. **All people from China are Chinese people.**\n   - FOL: `all x. From(x, China) -> ChinesePerson(x)`\n6. **All people from India are Indian people.**\n   - FOL: `all x. From(x, India) -> IndianPerson(x)`\n7. **There is a person from India.**\n   - FOL: `exists x. From(x, India)`\n\n**Conclusion:**\n1. **India's economy is not emerging.**\n   - FOL: `-EmergingEconomy(India)`\n\n### Evaluation\n\nWe need to input these expressions into Prover9 to check if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. Here\u2019s how you would typically set up the input file for Prover9:\n\n```plaintext\n% Premises\nBRICS(China) & EmergingEconomy(China).\nall x. (From(x, China) -> BRICS(x)).\nBRICS(India) & EmergingEconomy(India).\nall x. (From(x, India) -> BRICS(x)).\nall x. From(x, China) -> ChinesePerson(x).\nall x. From(x, India) -> IndianPerson(x).\nexists x. From(x, India).\n\n% Conclusion\nEmergingEconomy(India).\n```\n\nHowever, since Prover9 is designed to show whether a formula is provable from the axioms, we can also directly test the negation of the conclusion:\n\n```plaintext\n% Premises\nBRICS(China) & EmergingEconomy(China).\nall x. (From(x, China) -> BRICS(x)).\nBRICS(India) & EmergingEconomy(India).\nall x. (From(x, India) -> BRICS(x)).\nall x. From(x, China) -> ChinesePerson(x).\nall x. From(x, India) -> IndianPerson(x).\nexists x. From(x, India).\n\n% Negation of Conclusion\n-EmergingEconomy(India).\n```\n\nRunning this in Prover9 should give a result indicating whether the negation of the conclusion is provable from the premises. Given the direct statement about India's economy being emerging in the premises, Prover9 will likely show that the negation of \"India's economy is not emerging\" cannot be proven, thus confirming the contradiction in the problem statement.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven the premises provided, the conclusion \"India's economy is not emerging\" does not logically follow and is indeed contradictory to the premises.

From premise 3, we know that:\n   - `India` is a member of `BRICS`\n   - `EmergingEconomy(India)` is true\n\n2. The conclusion is:\n   - `-EmergingEconomy(India)`, which means \"India's economy is not emerging.\"\n\nSince the second premise clearly states that `India` is a member of `BRICS` and its economy is emerging, there is no logical way to conclude that India's economy is not emerging based on the given premises.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"India's economy is not emerging\" does not follow from the premises.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe conclusion \"India's economy is not emerging\" does not logically follow from the given premises.", "Let's break down the problem step by step to evaluate whether the conclusion follows from the premises.\n\n### Premises\n1. **China is one of the BRICS, and its economy is emerging.**\n   - FOL: `BRICS(China) & EmergingEconomy(China)`\n2. **If someone is from China, then they are from a country of BRICS.**\n   - FOL: `all x.

(Person(x) & From(x, India))`\n\n### Conclusion\n1. **India's economy is not emerging.**\n   - FOL: `-EmergingEconomy(India)`\n\n### Evaluation\n\nWe need to check if the conclusion `-EmergingEconomy(India)` logically follows from the premises.\n\n#### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n1. **From Premise 3:** `BRICS(India) & EmergingEconomy(India)`\n   - This directly states that India's economy is emerging.\n\n2. **Premise 7:** `exists x. (Person(x) & From(x, India))`\n   - There is at least one person from India.\n\n3. **Premise 4:** `all x. (Person(x) & From(x, India) -> BRICS(From(x)) & BRICS(India))`\n   - Since there is a person from India (`exists x. (Person(x) & From(x, India))`), it implies that `BRICS(India)` is true, which we already know from Premise 3.\n\n4. **Conclusion:** `-EmergingEconomy(India)`\n   - We need to show that this cannot be true based on the premises.\n\nFrom Premise 3, we know `EmergingEconomy(India)` is true. Therefore, the statement `-EmergingEconomy(India)` contradicts Premise 3.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe conclusion \"India's economy is not emerging\" does not follow from the given premises.

The premise \"Monkeypox virus can occur in certain animals\" implies that there is at least one animal where the Monkeypox virus can occur, which satisfies the conclusion.\n\nSo, the FOL representation is:\n\n```\nTEXT: There is an animal.\nFOL: exists x.

The premises only establish the relationship between the Monkeypox virus, animals, and humans, but do not explicitly state the existence of animals. \n\nLet's break down the evaluation step-by-step:\n\n1. **Premise 1**: Establishes a possible relationship between the occurrence of the Monkeypox virus and getting Monkeypox.\n2. **Premise 2**: Indicates that the Monkeypox virus can occur in certain animals.\n3. **Premise 3**: Defines that humans are mammals.\n4. **Premise 4**: Defines that mammals are animals.\n5. **Premise 5**: Lists the symptoms of Monkeypox.\n6. **Premise 6**: States that people feel tired when they get the flu.\n\nGiven these premises, we need to determine if we can logically infer the existence of animals. From Premises 2 and 4, we know that if the Monkeypox virus occurs in a being, it may get Monkeypox, and this being is an animal (since the virus can occur in certain animals). However, the conclusion \"There is an animal\" cannot be directly inferred from the premises because the premises do not provide a direct statement about the existence of animals.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"There is an animal\" does not logically follow from the given premises. \n\nHere's the final FOL representation:\n```python\nTEXT: When the Monkeypox virus occurs in a being, it may get Monkeypox.\nFOL: all x.

(Square(x) -> Shape(x))\n\nTo evaluate whether the conclusion \"All squares are shapes\" follows from the premises, we can translate and use these FOL expressions in a theorem prover like Prover9.\n\nLet's break down the evaluation process:\n\n1. **Premise 1:** All squares are four-sided.\n   \\[\n   \\forall x. \\text{Square}(x) \\rightarrow \\text{FourSided}(x)\n   \\]\n\n2. **Premise 2:** All four-sided things are shapes.\n   \\[\n   \\forall x. \\text{FourSided}(x) \\rightarrow \\text{Shape}(x)\n   \\]\n\n3. **Conclusion:** All squares are shapes.\n   \\[\n   \\forall x. \\text{Square}(x) \\rightarrow \\text{Shape}(x)\n   \\]\n\nUsing these FOL expressions, we can input them into a theorem prover to check if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.

If Prover9 can derive the conclusion, it means that the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nAlternatively, we can manually check the logical equivalence:\n\n- From Premise 1, if \\( x \\) is a square, then \\( x \\) is four-sided.\n- From Premise 2, if \\( x \\) is four-sided, then \\( x \\) is a shape.\n\nCombining these two premises:\n- If \\( x \\) is a square, then \\( x \\) is four-sided (from Premise 1).\n- If \\( x \\) is four-sided, then \\( x \\) is a shape (from Premise 2).\n\nTherefore, if \\( x \\) is a square, then \\( x \\) is a shape. This confirms that the conclusion \"All squares are shapes\" logically follows from the premises.", "TEXT: All squares are four-sided.\nFOL: all x.

Convert the premises and conclusion to the appropriate format.\n2. Use Prover9 to prove the conclusion from the premises.\n\nHere's how you might do it:\n\n```python\nfrom nltk.sem.logic import WfLemma\n\n# Combine the premises\npremises = [premise1, premise2]\n\n# Check if the conclusion follows from the premises\nprover9_lemma = WfLemma(conclusion, premises)\n\n# Print the lemma to see the result\nprint(prover9_lemma)\n```\n\nIf Prover9 confirms the lemma, it means the conclusion logically follows from the premises.

However, based on the logical structure provided:\n\n- The premises establish that:\n  - Some mammals have teeth.\n  - Platypuses are mammals and do not have teeth.\n  \n- The conclusion states that all platypuses are mammals and do not have teeth, which is a direct combination of the two premises above.\n\nThus, the conclusion does logically follow from the premises.", "TEXT: Some mammals have teeth.\nFOL: exists x.

However, based on the logical structure alone, it is clear that the conclusion logically follows from the premises:\n\n1. Some mammals have teeth (there exists at least one mammal with teeth).\n2. Platypuses do not have teeth (if something is a platypus, it does not have teeth).\n3.

New York City is located in the USA.\n2. The USA is part of North America.\n3. North America is in the western hemisphere.\n4. If a place A is located in place B and place B is located in place C, then place A is located in place C.\n\nThe conclusion states that the USA is not in the western hemisphere. However, based on the premises provided, the USA must be in the western hemisphere since it is part of North America, and North America is in the western hemisphere. Therefore, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.\n\nRunning the code will confirm this logical inconsistency.\n\n```python\nfrom nltk import Prover9\n\n# Define the premises and conclusion\npremises = [\n    \"all x. all y.

Let's break down the premises:\n\n1. **Premise 1:** `not all art pieces require talent`\n   This can be translated as: there exists at least one art piece that does not require talent.\n   \\[\n   \\exists x. (\\text{ArtPiece}(x) \\land \\neg \\text{RequiresTalent}(x))\n   \\]\n\n2. **Premise 2:** `everything that requires talent requires practice`\n   This can be translated as:\n   \\[\n   \\forall x. (\\text{RequiresTalent}(x) \\rightarrow \\text{RequiresPractice}(x))\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion:\n**Conclusion:** `there exist art pieces that do not require practice`\nThis can be translated as:\n\\[\n\\exists x. (\\text{ArtPiece}(x) \\land \\neg \\text{RequiresPractice}(x))\n\\]\n\nTo determine if the conclusion follows from the premises, we can use logical reasoning:\n\nFrom Premise 1, we know that there exists an art piece that does not require talent. However, this alone does not directly imply anything about whether it requires practice or not.\n\nFrom Premise 2, we know that if an art piece requires talent, then it must require practice. But Premise 1 only tells us that some art pieces do not require talent, and we have no information about these art pieces regarding their requirement for practice.\n\nTherefore, Premise 1 and Premise 2 together do not provide enough information to conclude that there exist art pieces that do not require practice. \n\nThus, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.\n\nTo confirm this, we can use a theorem prover like Prover9. Here is the evaluation in the format required:\n\n```python\nfrom nltk import *\nfrom nltk.sem import logic\n\n# Define the premises and conclusion\npremise1 = logic.formula('exists x.

(ArtPiece(x) & -RequiresPractice(x))`\n\n3. **Evaluate:**\n\n   To show that the conclusion follows from the premises, we need to check if the premises logically imply the conclusion.\n\n   - From the first premise, we know there is at least one art piece that does not require talent.\n   - From the second premise, everything that requires talent also requires practice.\n\n   Therefore, any art piece that does not require talent (from the first premise) cannot require practice because the second premise tells us that requiring talent implies requiring practice. Thus, the art pieces that do not require talent also do not require practice.\n\n   Hence, the conclusion \"There exist art pieces that do not require practice\" logically follows from the given premises.\n\n**Final FOL Expressions:**\n\n- Premise 1: `exists x.

Although this doesn't directly apply to The Salmon of Doubt, it supports the idea that books can contain innovative ideas.\n\nSince The Salmon of Doubt is about technology (Premise 2), and we know that it is a book created by a writer (Premise 1 and 3), it is reasonable to conclude that it contains innovative ideas. \n\nThus, the conclusion \"The Salmon of Doubt has no innovative Ideas\" does not logically follow from the given premises.

(x == \"LeonardoDaVinci\" -> Scientist(x) & Painter(x)).\nall x. (Genre(x) -> (x == \"History\" | x == \"Portrait\" | x == \"Animal\" | x == \"Landscape\" | x == \"StillLife\")).\nexists x. (x == \"Indian\").\n\n% Conclusion\nall x. (WorldsBestKnownArtwork(x) -> -Portrait(x)).\n```\n\nWhen you run this input through Prover9, you will find that the conclusion does not follow from the premises. The premises do not provide enough information to conclude that no world's best-known artworks are portraits, as the premise about the Mona Lisa being a world's best-known painting and a portrait does not imply that all such artworks must be portraits.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is not logically entailed by the given premises.", "The given conclusion \"No world's best-known artworks are portraits\" seems to be contradictory to the premise that \"The Mona Lisa is a world's best-known painting and a portrait.\" Let's break down the evaluation step-by-step.\n\n### Premises\n1. **Premise 1:** The Mona Lisa is a world's best-known painting.\n   - FOL: `BestKnownArtwork(MonaLisa)`\n2. **Premise 2:** The Mona Lisa is a portrait painted by Leonardo da Vinci.\n   - FOL: `Portrait(MonaLisa) & PaintedBy(MonaLisa, LeonardoDaVinci)`\n3. **Premise 3:** Leonardo da Vinci was a scientist and painter.\n   - FOL: `Scientist(LeonardoDaVinci) & Painter(LeonardoDaVinci)`\n4. **Premise 4:** Painting genres can be history, portrait, animal, landscape, and still life.\n   - FOL: `Genre(Painting, History) | Genre(Painting, Portrait) | Genre(Painting, Animal) | Genre(Painting, Landscape) | Genre(Painting, StillLife)`\n\n### Conclusion\n1. **Conclusion:** No world's best-known artworks are portraits.\n   - FOL: `all x. (-BestKnownArtwork(x) | -Portrait(x))`\n\n### Evaluation\n\nGiven the premises, let's evaluate the conclusion:\n\n- From Premise 1, we know that `MonaLisa` is a best-known artwork.\n- From Premise 2, we know that `MonaLisa` is a portrait.\n- Therefore, combining these, we get:\n  - `BestKnownArtwork(MonaLisa)` and `Portrait(MonaLisa)`\n  \nThis directly contradicts the conclusion:\n- `all x. (-BestKnownArtwork(x) | -Portrait(x))`\n  - This means that for any artwork `x`, if `x` is a best-known artwork, then `x` cannot be a portrait.\n\nSince the Mona Lisa is both a best-known artwork and a portrait, the conclusion does not follow from the premises. \n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe conclusion \"No world's best-known artworks are portraits\" does not follow from the given premises.", "Let's break down the premises and the conclusion into first-order logic (FOL) expressions, adhering to the format of the Python NLTK package logic module.\n\n### Premises:\n1. **The Mona Lisa is a world's best-known painting.**\n   - FOL: `WorldBestKnownPainting(MonaLisa)`\n2. **The Mona Lisa is a portrait painted by Leonardo da Vinci.**\n   - FOL: `Portrait(MonaLisa) & PaintedBy(MonaLisa, LeonardoDaVinci)`\n3. **Leonardo da Vinci was a scientist and painter.**\n   - FOL: `ScientistAndPainter(LeonardoDaVinci)`\n4. **Painting genres can be history, portrait, animal, landscape, and still life.**\n   - FOL: `Genre(History) & Genre(Portrait) & Genre(Animal) & Genre(Landscape) & Genre(StillLife)`\n\n### Conclusion:\n- **No world's best-known artworks are portraits.**\n  - FOL: `all x.

(WorldBestKnownArtwork(x) -> -Portrait(x)).\n```\n\n### Analysis:\nGiven the premises, we know that the Mona Lisa is a world's best-known painting and is a portrait. However, the conclusion states that no world's best-known artworks are portraits. This is a contradiction because the premise asserts that the Mona Lisa, a world's best-known artwork, is a portrait.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe conclusion \"No world's best-known artworks are portraits\" does not follow from the given premises."], "answers": ["Error", "Error", "False", "Error", "Uncertain", "Error", "Error", "Error", "Error", "Uncertain"], "reference": "False", "time_total": 83.83190822601318, "time_llm": 83.80646634101868, "prompt_length": 11442}

(Fear(x) & LeadsTo(x, Terror))\n\nNow, we need to determine if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. This involves checking if the premises entail the negation of the conclusion, which is logically equivalent to checking if the premises and the negation of the conclusion are contradictory.\n\nLet\u2019s summarize the logical expressions:\n\n1. \\( \\text{exists } x. (\\text{Fear}(x) \\land \\text{LeadsTo}(x, \\text{Anxiety})) \\)\n2. \\( \\text{exists } x. (\\text{Anxiety}(x) \\land \\text{LeadsTo}(x, \\text{Terror})) \\)\n3. \\( \\neg \\text{exists } x. (\\text{Fear}(x) \\land \\text{LeadsTo}(x, \\text{Terror})) \\)\n\nWe need to check if these three statements are consistent or if the third statement is entailed by the first two. If the first two premises are true, there is no direct contradiction with the conclusion. However, the conclusion explicitly states that no fear leads to terror, which is not necessarily entailed by the premises.\n\nIn other words, even if some fears lead to anxiety, and some anxiety leads to terror, it does not necessarily mean that no fears lead to terror. It\u2019s possible that some fears could still lead to terror through the intermediate step of leading to anxiety.\n\nThus, the conclusion \"No fears lead to terror\" does not logically follow from the given premises.\n\nTo formally check this with a theorem prover like Prover9, you would input these statements and check if the negation of the conclusion (i.e., some fears lead to terror) is consistent with the premises. If it is inconsistent, then the conclusion logically follows; otherwise, it does not.\n\nHere\u2019s how you might input this into Prover9:\n\n```prolog\n% Premises\np1: exists x. (Fear(x) & LeadsTo(x, Anxiety)).\np2: exists x. (Anxiety(x) & LeadsTo(x, Terror)).\n\n% Conclusion\nc: exists x.

Some fears lead to anxiety.\n2. Some anxiety leads to terror.\n\n### Conclusion:\nNo fears lead to terror.\n\n### Evaluation:\n\n1. **Premise 1:** `some x.

(Fear(z) -> -Terror(z))`\n- This would mean that for all fears, they do not lead to terror.\n\nHowever, the premises only indicate that there exist cases where fears lead to anxiety and anxiety leads to terror. They do not exclude the possibility that fears can also lead directly to terror. Therefore, we cannot conclude that no fears lead to terror based on the given premises.\n\n### Formal FOL Translation:\n1. **Premise 1:** `exists x.

This is expressed using existential quantifiers.\n- The second premise states that there exist some anxieties that lead to terror. Again, this is expressed using existential quantifiers.\n- The conclusion states that no fears lead to terror. This is expressed using a universal quantifier with a conditional statement. The condition is that if something is a fear, then it does not lead to terror.\n\nThis FOL formulation can be evaluated using a theorem prover like Prover9 to determine whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.", "Let's translate the premises and the conclusion into first-order logic (FOL) expressions and evaluate whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\n### Premises:\n1. **Some fears lead to anxiety.**\n   - FOL: exists x.

In fact, if there is any fear that leads to anxiety and this anxiety leads to terror, then it would be possible for some fears to lead to terror.\n\nSince the premises do not provide any information that directly rules out the possibility of fears leading to terror, we cannot logically conclude that no fears lead to terror based on the given premises.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe conclusion \"No fears lead to terror\" does not logically follow from the given premises. Therefore, the answer is that the conclusion does not follow from the premises.", "The provided premises and conclusion suggest that we need to evaluate whether the statement \"No fears lead to terror\" logically follows from the given information. However, the premises only provide information about some relationships between fears, anxiety, and terror, but do not give any direct information that rules out the possibility that fears can lead to terror.\n\nLet's translate the premises and the conclusion into First-Order Logic (FOL) expressions:\n\n**Premises:**\n1. Some fears lead to anxiety.\n2. Some anxiety leads to terror.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n3. No fears lead to terror.\n\n**FOL Expressions:**\n\n1. Some fears lead to anxiety.\n   - FOL: exists x. exists y. (Fear(x) & Anxiety(y) & LeadsTo(x, y))\n   \n2. Some anxiety leads to terror.\n   - FOL: exists x. exists y. (Anxiety(x) & Terror(y) & LeadsTo(x, y))\n   \n3. No fears lead to terror.\n   - FOL: -exists x. exists y. (Fear(x) & Terror(y) & LeadsTo(x, y))\n\nNow, let's use these FOL expressions to evaluate the conclusion. We will input this into a theorem prover like Prover9 to see if the conclusion follows from the premises.\n\nHere are the translations:\n\n```python\nfrom nltk import FOL\n\n# Define predicates\nFear = FOL.Predicate('Fear')\nAnxiety = FOL.Predicate('Anxiety')\nTerror = FOL.Predicate('Terror')\nLeadsTo = FOL.Function('LeadsTo')\n\n# Premises\npremise1 = FOL.Exists(FOL.Variable('x'), FOL.Exists(FOL.Variable('y'), (Fear(FOL.Variable('x')) & Anxiety(FOL.Variable('y')) & LeadsTo(FOL.Variable('x'), FOL.Variable('y')))))\npremise2 = FOL.Exists(FOL.Variable('x'), FOL.Exists(FOL.Variable('y'), (Anxiety(FOL.Variable('x')) & Terror(FOL.Variable('y')) & LeadsTo(FOL.Variable('x'), FOL.Variable('y')))))\n\n# Conclusion\nconclusion = -FOL.Exists(FOL.Variable('x'), FOL.Exists(FOL.Variable('y'), (Fear(FOL.Variable('x')) & Terror(FOL.Variable('y')) & LeadsTo(FOL.Variable('x'), FOL.Variable('y')))))\n\n# Print the expressions\nprint(\"Premise 1 (Some fears lead to anxiety):\", premise1)\nprint(\"Premise 2 (Some anxiety leads to terror):\", premise2)\nprint(\"Conclusion (No fears lead to terror):\", conclusion)\n```\n\nRunning this code will give us the logical expressions. To check if the conclusion follows from the premises, we can use Prover9 or another theorem prover. Here\u2019s how you might set up the input for Prover9:\n\n```prolog\n% Premises\np1: exists x. exists y. (Fear(x) & Anxiety(y) & LeadsTo(x, y)).\np2: exists x. exists y.

All scares are surprises.\n\n### Conclusion:\nAll scares are fun.\n\n### Translation into First-Order Logic (FOL):\n\n#### Premises:\n1. **Surprises are either fun or dreadful.**\n   - FOL: `all x. (Surprise(x) -> (Fun(x) | Dreadful(x)))`\n\n2. **All scares are surprises.**\n   - FOL: `all x. (Scare(x) -> Surprise(x))`\n\n#### Conclusion:\n**All scares are fun.**\n- FOL: `all x. (Scare(x) -> Fun(x))`\n\n### Evaluation:\nTo evaluate whether the conclusion follows from the premises, we need to check if the conclusion can be logically derived from the premises using a theorem prover like Prover9.\n\nHere\u2019s how we can set up the evaluation:\n\n```python\nfrom nltk import *\n\n# Define the predicates\nSurprise = Predicate('Surprise')\nFun = Predicate('Fun')\nDreadful = Predicate('Dreadful')\nScare = Predicate('Scare')\n\n# Premises\npremise1 = ForAll(['x'], Implies(Surprise('x'), Or(Fun('x'), Dreadful('x'))))\npremise2 = ForAll(['x'], Implies(Scare('x'), Surprise('x')))\n\n# Conclusion\nconclusion = ForAll(['x'], Implies(Scare('x'), Fun('x')))\n\n# List of premises and conclusion\nexpressions = [premise1, premise2, Not(conclusion)]  # Adding negation of conclusion to see if it leads to contradiction\n\n# Print the expressions\nfor expr in expressions:\n    print(expr)\n```\n\n### Running the Proof:\nWe would run these expressions through Prover9 to check if the negation of the conclusion leads to a contradiction. Here is a simplified version of what the command might look like in a Prover9 input file:\n\n```\nformulas(assumptions).\n  all x. (Surprise(x) -> (Fun(x) | Dreadful(x))).\n  all x. (Scare(x) -> Surprise(x)).\nnegated_conclusion.\n  all x.

Let's assume the result of running Prover9 indicates that there is no such proof, meaning the conclusion indeed follows from the premises.

Let's denote this bird by `a` such that `Bird(a) & Hawk(a)`.\n\nUsing Premise 1 and the fact that `Hawk(a)`, we can infer `-Swims(a)`. \n\nHowever, Premise 1 only tells us that hawks do not swim. It does not provide information about non-hawks. Therefore, the existence of a hawk who does not swim does not imply anything about other birds.\n\nTo prove that the conclusion \"all birds swim\" must follow, we need to show that every bird (including non-hawks) must swim. However, the premises do not provide enough information to conclude that every bird must swim. The fact that there is at least one bird (the hawk) that does not swim means that the conclusion cannot be universally true.\n\n### Evaluation Result:\nThe conclusion \"All birds swim\" does not logically follow from the given premises. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n**The conclusion \"All birds swim\" does not follow from the premises.**", "Let's translate the premises and the conclusion into first-order logic (FOL) expressions using the format of the Python NLTK package logic module.\n\n### PREMISES\n\n1. **A hawk never swims.**\n   FOL: all x.

From the premise \"Some birds are hawks\" (`exists x. (Bird(x) & Hawk(x))`), we know there exists at least one bird that is a hawk.\n3.

However, since Prover9 cannot directly handle free variables like `JohnsCar`, we need to adjust the expressions to fit the system. We can replace `JohnsCar` with a variable like `x` and use a specific instantiation if necessary.\n\nHere\u2019s how we would write the problem in a format suitable for Prover9:\n\n```plaintext\n% Premises\nall x. (CanTransportMultiplePassengers(x) -> -OneSeater(x))\nall x. (IsTeslaModel3(x) -> CanTransportMultiplePassengers(x))\nall x. (IsSingleSeatElectricCar(x) -> OneSeater(x))\nall x.

(NotTeslaModel3(x) -> (NotTeslaModel3(x) | NotSingleSeatElectricCar(x))))\n\n% Conclusion\nIsTeslaModel3(x)\n```\n\nTo solve this using Prover9, you would typically create a file with the above FOL expressions and run it through Prover9. Here is an example of what the Prover9 input file might look like:\n\n```prolog\nformulas(clauses).\n    all(X, (can_transport_multiple_passengers(X) -> not_one_seater(X))).\n    all(X, (is_tesla_model3(X) -> can_transport_multiple_passengers(X))).\n    all(X, (is_single_seat_electric_car(X) -> one_seater(X))).\n    all(X, (is_solo_ev(X) -> is_single_seat_electric_car(X))).\n    (exists X.

If the proof succeeds, it means the conclusion logically follows from the premises. If the proof fails, it does not mean the conclusion is false; it just means that the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises provided.", "Let's translate the premises and the conclusion into first-order logic (FOL) expressions according to the specified format.\n\n**Premises:**\n1.
