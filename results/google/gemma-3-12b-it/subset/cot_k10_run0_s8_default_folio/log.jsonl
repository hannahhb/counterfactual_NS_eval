Therefore, \"If a person is hungry, then the person is unhappy.\"\n\nHowever, the conclusion is \"If a person is not hungry, the person is unhappy.\" This is the inverse of the derived statement. The inverse of a conditional statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises.\n\nFor example, someone could be not hungry, but still unhappy for some other reason.\n\nANSWER:\tFalse", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if \"if a person is not hungry, the person is unhappy.\" We are given that if a person is hungry, the person is uncomfortable, and if a person is uncomfortable, the person is unhappy. This implies that if a person is hungry, the person is unhappy.\n\nNow, let's consider the contrapositive of the first statement: \"If a person is not uncomfortable, the person is not hungry.\" Similarly, the contrapositive of the second statement is \"If a person is not unhappy, the person is not uncomfortable.\"\n\nCombining these, we get: \"If a person is not unhappy, then the person is not uncomfortable, and therefore the person is not hungry.\" This is equivalent to \"If a person is happy, then the person is not hungry.\"\n\nHowever, we want to know \"If a person is not hungry, the person is unhappy.\" This is not what is given. Let's consider a scenario where a person is not hungry. It is possible that the person is uncomfortable for another reason (e.g., tired, bored). If they are uncomfortable, then they are unhappy. But if they are not uncomfortable, they may be happy. This makes the conclusion false.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to use Modus Tollens. We have:\n1. Hungry -> Uncomfortable\n2. Uncomfortable -> Unhappy\nTherefore, Hungry -> Unhappy.\n\nThe conclusion is: Not Hungry -> Unhappy.\nThis is the fallacy of denying the antecedent.  Just because being hungry leads to unhappiness doesn't mean that not being hungry leads to unhappiness.\n\nFor example, someone might be unhappy for other reasons, even if they are not hungry.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion does not follow from the premises.\nANSWER:\tFalse", "Let's think step by step. We are given two premises:\n1. If a person is hungry, the person is uncomfortable. (H -> U)\n2. If a person is uncomfortable, the person is unhappy. (U -> N)\n\nWe want to evaluate the conclusion: If a person is not hungry, the person is unhappy. (~H -> N)\n\nFrom the premises, we can deduce that if a person is hungry, then the person is unhappy (H -> N). This is due to the transitive property of implication.\n\nHowever, we cannot conclude that if a person is *not* hungry, then the person is unhappy. The premises only state what happens if a person *is* hungry. It doesn't provide any information about what happens if a person is not hungry. A person could be not hungry and happy, or not hungry and uncomfortable, or not hungry and unhappy. The conclusion is not logically valid.\n\nTherefore, the statement is False.\nANSWER:\tFalse", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if, if a person is not hungry, the person is unhappy. We are given that if a person is hungry, they are uncomfortable, and if a person is uncomfortable, they are unhappy. Therefore, if a person is hungry, they are unhappy.\nThe statement we want to evaluate is \"if a person is not hungry, the person is unhappy.\" This is the inverse of the first premise. The inverse of a conditional statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement. For example, it is possible that a person is not hungry, and also not uncomfortable, and therefore not unhappy. Therefore, we cannot conclude that if a person is not hungry, they are unhappy. Therefore, the statement is false.\nANSWER:\tFalse", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if \"If a person is not hungry, the person is unhappy\". We are given that \"If a person is hungry, the person is uncomfortable\" and \"If a person is uncomfortable, the person is unhappy.\"\nLet H be \"a person is hungry\", U be \"a person is uncomfortable\", and N be \"a person is unhappy.\"\nThe premises can be written as:\n1. H -> U\n2. U -> N\nFrom these premises, we can deduce H -> N. This is the transitive property.\nThe conclusion is \"If a person is not hungry, the person is unhappy\" or ~H -> N.\nThis is the inverse of the original conditional statement H -> N. The inverse is not logically equivalent to the original statement.\nConsider the case where a person is not hungry (~H). It's possible that they are not uncomfortable (~U), and therefore they are not unhappy (~N). So, ~H does not necessarily imply N.\nTherefore, the conclusion does not follow from the premises.\n\nANSWER:\tFalse", "Let's think step by step. We are given two premises: (1) If a person is hungry, then the person is uncomfortable, and (2) If a person is uncomfortable, then the person is unhappy. We want to evaluate the conclusion: If a person is not hungry, then the person is unhappy.\n\nLet's use the contrapositive of premise (1). The contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\" So, the contrapositive of premise (1) is \"If a person is not uncomfortable, then the person is not hungry.\"\nSimilarly, the contrapositive of premise (2) is \"If a person is not unhappy, then the person is not uncomfortable.\"\n\nNow, we can chain these together. If a person is not hungry, then the person is not uncomfortable (from the contrapositive of premise 1). If the person is not uncomfortable, then the person is not unhappy (from the contrapositive of premise 2). Therefore, if a person is not hungry, then the person is not unhappy.\n\nThe given conclusion is \"If a person is not hungry, then the person is unhappy.\" This is the opposite of what we derived. Thus, the conclusion is false.\n\nANSWER: False", "Let's think step by step. We are given that if a person is hungry, the person is uncomfortable, and if a person is uncomfortable, the person is unhappy. We want to evaluate if if a person is not hungry, the person is unhappy. Let's represent the premises using logical notation:\nH -> U (If hungry, then uncomfortable)\nU -> N (If uncomfortable, then unhappy)\n\nFrom these two premises, we can conclude that H -> N (If hungry, then unhappy) by transitivity.\n\nNow, we are given the conclusion: If a person is not hungry, the person is unhappy. This can be written as ~H -> N.\n\nWe know that H -> N is true. However, this does not necessarily mean that ~H -> N is true. Consider the following counterexample:\n\nSuppose H represents \"a person is hungry\", U represents \"a person is uncomfortable\", and N represents \"a person is unhappy.\"\n\nLet's say a person is not hungry (~H). It's possible they are unhappy (N) for some other reason, but it's also possible they are not unhappy (~N). The premises do not state that being hungry is the *only* reason for being unhappy.\n\nFor example, a person might be unhappy because they are sad, even if they are not hungry. Therefore, the statement ~H -> N does not necessarily follow from the premises.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is false.\n\nANSWER:\tFalse", "Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if \"if a person is not hungry, the person is unhappy\". We know that if a person is hungry, then the person is uncomfortable, and if a person is uncomfortable, then the person is unhappy. Therefore, if a person is hungry, the person is unhappy. Now, let's consider the contrapositive of the statement \"if a person is not hungry, the person is unhappy\". The contrapositive is \"if a person is not unhappy, the person is hungry.\" This is not what the premise tells us. We can't conclude that if a person is not hungry, they are unhappy. They could be comfortable and happy. Therefore, the statement is false.\nANSWER:\tFalse", "Let's think step by step.\nWe are given:\n1. If a person is hungry, then the person is uncomfortable. (H -> U)\n2. If a person is uncomfortable, then the person is unhappy. (U -> N)\nWe want to evaluate:\nIf a person is not hungry, then the person is unhappy. (~H -> N)\n\nFrom premises 1 and 2, we can infer that if a person is hungry, then the person is unhappy (H -> N) by the transitive property.\n\nHowever, the conclusion states that if a person is *not* hungry, then the person is unhappy (~H -> N). This is the fallacy of denying the antecedent. We cannot conclude that if someone isn't hungry, they are unhappy. They might be comfortable and happy for other reasons.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises.\n\nANSWER:\tFalse", "Let's think step by step. We are given that if a person is hungry, then they are uncomfortable, and if a person is uncomfortable, then they are unhappy. Therefore, if a person is hungry, they are unhappy.\nThe conclusion is \"if a person is not hungry, then the person is unhappy.\" This is not necessarily true.
