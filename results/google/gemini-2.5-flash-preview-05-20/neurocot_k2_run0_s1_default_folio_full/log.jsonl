(FemalePlayerRG2022(x) -> LostToIgaSwiatek(x))\nTEXT: Either female tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 or male tennis players at Roland Garros 2022.\nREASONING: This statement asserts that for any given tennis player at Roland Garros 2022, they are either a female tennis player or a male tennis player. It does not state that *all* players are one or the other, but rather that for any player, they must fall into one of these two categories, assuming they are indeed a player at RG 2022. However, the phrasing \"Either female tennis players at Roland Garros 2022 or male tennis players at Roland Garros 2022\" is ambiguous. It could mean \"All players at RG2022 are either female or male\" or \"There exists a female player at RG2022 or there exists a male player at RG2022\". Given the context of logical deduction, the most common interpretation for such a premise is that every relevant individual belongs to one of these two categories. I will interpret it as \"If someone is a tennis player at Roland Garros 2022, then they are either a female tennis player at Roland Garros 2022 or a male tennis player at Roland Garros 2022\". However, without a general predicate for \"TennisPlayerRG2022\", and given that the subsequent premises talk about \"all male tennis players\", it's more likely a disjunction about the *types* of players present. I will interpret it as a general statement about the categories of players at Roland Garros 2022, meaning that any player at RG 2022 is either female or male. But since the question is about specific individuals, I will express it as \"for any x, if x is a player at RG2022, then x is a FemalePlayerRG2022 or x is a MalePlayerRG2022\". If there's no general predicate for \"player at Roland Garros 2022\", it might imply a universal truth about gender categories for players. For the purpose of this problem, and considering the phrasing, I will interpret it as a disjunction that *characterizes* the set of players at Roland Garros 2022, meaning that any player at Roland Garros 2022 must be either female or male. Without a general predicate for \"player at Roland Garros 2022\", and given the subsequent premise about \"All male tennis players at Roland Garros 2022\", it's best to treat this as a statement about the nature of the individuals under consideration. I will assume it means that any entity that is a \"tennis player at Roland Garros 2022\" falls into one of these two categories. Since the problem doesn't provide a general \"TennisPlayerRG2022\" predicate, I will express it as a disjunction that must hold for any relevant individual, implying that for any x, if x is considered a player from RG 2022, it must be either female or male. A simpler, common interpretation of \"Either A or B\" in premises when A and B are categories is that any relevant individual belongs to A or B.\nFOL: all x.
