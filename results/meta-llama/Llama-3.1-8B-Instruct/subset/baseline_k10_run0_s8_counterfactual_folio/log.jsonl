(A)\nAll woodware is biodegradable. (B)\nAll paper is woodware. (C)\nNothing is a good thing and also a bad thing. (D)\nAll environment-friendly things are good. (E)\nA worksheet is either paper or environment-friendly. (F)\nA worksheet is not biodegradable. (G)\n\nPremises:\n- From B and C, we get All paper is biodegradable.\n- From A, we get All biodegradable things are environment-friendly, and from E, we get All environment-friendly things are good.\n- From F, we get A worksheet is either paper or good.\n- From G, we get A worksheet is not biodegradable.\n\nConclusion (G): A worksheet is not biodegradable. \n\nWe can prove this using Modus Tollens: If A then B, and A then not B is False. But here we have a worksheet is either paper or environment-friendly. If it is paper, then it is biodegradable. And if it is environment-friendly, then it is biodegradable. So A worksheet is either paper or biodegradable. But we know it is not biodegradable. We can use Modus Tollens again, if it is environment-friendly then it is biodegradable, and it is not biodegradable. But it is environment-friendly because it is good. But that is a contradiction to D, so it is not good. From F, we get A worksheet is either paper or good. If it is good, then it is environment-friendly, which is a contradiction to D. So we have shown A worksheet is not biodegradable.\n\nTherefore, ANSWER: True.\n\n2.\nA La Liga soccer team ranks higher than another La Liga soccer team if it receives more points. (A)\nIf there are two La Liga soccer teams and neither has more points than the other, then the team which receives more points from the games between the two teams ranks higher. (B)\nReal Madrid and Barcelona are both La Liga soccer teams. (C)\nReal Madrid received more points than Barcelona. (D)\nNeither Real Madrid nor Barcelona received more points from the games between them. (E)\nReal Madrid ranks higher than Barcelona. (F)\n\nPremises:\n- From A and D, we get Real Madrid ranks higher than Barcelona.\n- From B, E and C, we get Real Madrid does not rank higher than Barcelona.\n- From F, we get Real Madrid ranks higher than Barcelona.\n\nConclusion (F): Real Madrid ranks higher than Barcelona. \n\nWe can prove this using Modus Ponens: If A and B, then C. Here we have A, B and C. We know from A and D that Real Madrid ranks higher than Barcelona. From B, we get if Real Madrid receives more points from the games between them, then Real Madrid ranks higher than Barcelona. From E, we get Real Madrid does not receive more points from the games between them. We can use Modus Tollens, if Real Madrid receives more points from the games between them, then Real Madrid ranks higher than Barcelona, but Real Madrid does not receive more points from the games between them. So from A and D, we get Real Madrid ranks higher than Barcelona.\n\nTherefore, ANSWER: True.\n\n3.\nAll professional athletes spend most of their time on sports. (A)\nAll Olympic gold medal winners are professional athletes. (B)\nNo full-time scientists spend the majority of their time on sports. (C)\nAll Nobel physics laureates are full-time scientists. (D)\nAmy spends the most time on sports, or Amy is an Olympic gold medal winner. (E)\nIf Amy is not a Nobel physics laureate, then Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner. (F)\n\nPremises:\n- From A and B, we get All Olympic gold medal winners spend most of their time on sports.\n- From C and D, we get All Nobel physics laureates do not spend the majority of their time on sports.\n- From E and F, we get If Amy is not a Nobel physics laureate, then Amy is an Olympic gold medal winner.\n\nConclusion: If Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner, then Amy is a Nobel physics laureate. (G)\n\nFrom E and F, we get If Amy is not a Nobel physics laureate, then Amy is an Olympic gold medal winner. So we have two possibilities: Amy is a Nobel physics laureate or Amy is an Olympic gold medal winner. If Amy is an Olympic gold medal winner, then Amy spends most of their time on sports. From C and D, we get Amy is not a Nobel physics laureate, because then Amy would not spend most of their time on sports. So we get that Amy is a Nobel physics laureate. Therefore, we can conclude that the conclusion is false.\n\nTherefore, ANSWER: False.\n\n4.\nIf a person pays their taxes, then they contribute to the country.

it is possible that a worksheet is biodegradable. The premises do not provide enough information to determine whether a worksheet is biodegradable or not. Therefore, the conclusion is uncertain.\n\nANSWER: Uncertain", "Here are the solutions to the given first-order logic problems.\n\n1.\n\nThe premises are:\n- All biodegradable things are environment-friendly.\n- All woodware is biodegradable.\n- All paper is woodware.\n- Nothing is a good thing and also a bad thing.\n- All environment-friendly things are good.\n- A worksheet is either paper or environment-friendly.\n\nThe conclusion is:\n- A worksheet is not biodegradable.\n\nTo evaluate the conclusion, we can start by analyzing the premises. From the first three premises, we can conclude that all paper is biodegradable and, therefore, all environment-friendly things are biodegradable. However, the sixth premise states that a worksheet is either paper or environment-friendly. This means that a worksheet is biodegradable, which contradicts the conclusion.\n\nANSWER: False\n\n2.\n\nThe premises are:\n- A La Liga soccer team ranks higher than another La Liga soccer team if it receives more points.\n- If there are two La Liga soccer teams and neither has more points than the other, then the team which receives more points from the games between the two teams ranks higher.\n- Real Madrid and Barcelona are both La Liga soccer teams.\n- Real Madrid received more points than Barcelona.\n- Neither Real Madrid nor Barcelona received more points from the games between them.\n\nThe conclusion is:\n- Real Madrid ranks higher than Barcelona.\n\nFrom the first premise, we can conclude that Real Madrid ranks higher than Barcelona since Real Madrid received more points. The second premise is not relevant in this case since one team (Real Madrid) has more points than the other. Therefore, the conclusion follows from the premises.\n\nANSWER: True\n\n3.\n\nThe premises are:\n- All professional athletes spend most of their time on sports.\n- All Olympic gold medal winners are professional athletes.\n- No full-time scientists spend the majority of their time on sports.\n- All Nobel physics laureates are full-time scientists.\n- Amy spends the most time on sports, or Amy is an Olympic gold medal winner.\n- If Amy is not a Nobel physics laureate, then Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner.\n\nThe conclusion is:\n- If Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner, then Amy is a Nobel physics laureate.\n\nWe can start by analyzing the premises. From the first and second premises, we can conclude that Amy is a professional athlete, and from the third and fourth premises, we can conclude that Amy is not a full-time scientist. The fifth premise states that Amy is either an Olympic gold medal winner or a professional athlete, and the sixth premise states that if Amy is not a Nobel physics laureate, then she is not an Olympic gold medal winner. Since we know that Amy is not a full-time scientist, we can conclude that she is an Olympic gold medal winner. Therefore, if Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner, it must be because she is a Nobel physics laureate, which contradicts the conclusion.\n\nANSWER: False\n\n4.\n\nThe premises are:\n- If a person pays their taxes, then they contribute to the country.\n- Everyone who works for a government department pays a tax on their salary.\n- Everyone in the army is an employee of a government department.\n- Everyone convicted of murder goes to prison.\n- Everyone who has been to prison has a criminal record.\n- James was either once convicted of murder, or spent time in prison.\n- James either has a criminal record, or pays his taxes.\n\nThe conclusion is:\n- James does not contribute to the country.\n\nFrom the first premise, we can conclude that if James pays his taxes, then he contributes to the country. The second and third premises state that everyone who works for a government department pays a tax on their salary, which implies that James pays his taxes if he is in the army. However, the sixth premise states that James was either once convicted of murder or spent time in prison, and the seventh premise states that James either has a criminal record or pays his taxes. If James has a criminal record, it is because he spent time in prison, which would mean that he does not pay his taxes. Therefore, we cannot conclude that James does not contribute to the country.\n\nANSWER: Uncertain\n\n5.\n\nThe premises are:\n- No songs are visuals.\n- All folk songs are songs.\n- All videos are visuals.\n- All movies are videos.\n- All sci-fi movies are movies.\n- Inception is a sci-fi movie.\n- Mac is neither a folk song nor a sci-fi movie.\n\nThe conclusion is:\n- Inception is a folk song.\n\nFrom the first and second premises, we can conclude that all folk songs are not visuals. The fourth and fifth premises state that all movies are videos and all sci-fi movies are movies, respectively. Therefore, Inception is a video, which is a visual. This contradicts the conclusion.\n\nANSWER: False\n\n6.\n\nThe premises are:\n- Every chef can cook.\n- Some people who aren\u2019t chefs can cook.\n- People who cook can make scrambled eggs and pasta.\n- If someone can make cookies and muffins, they are a baker.\n- Bakers who can also make scrambled eggs can make a good breakfast.\n- Luke can make cookies, scrambled eggs, and muffins, but not pasta.\n\nThe conclusion is:\n- Luke is a chef.\n\nFrom the first premise, we can conclude that every chef can cook. However, the second premise states that some people who are not chefs can cook, which means that Luke is not a chef.\n\nANSWER: False\n\n7.\n\nThe premises are:\n- ETS develops various standardized tests primarily in the United States for K-12 and higher education.\n- ETS administers international tests, including the TOEFL, TOEIC, GRE, and subject tests.\n- Many of the assessments ETS develops are associated with entry to the US tertiary and quaternary education institutions.\n- ETS also develops K-12 statewide assessments used for accountability testing in many states.\n\nThe conclusion is:\n- ETS doesn't administer tests internationally.\n\nThis conclusion is directly contradicted by the second premise, which states that ETS administers international tests.\n\nANSWER: False\n\n8.\n\nThe premises are:\n- Daveed Diggs is an actor and film producer.\n- Daveed Diggs played two roles in the musical Hamilton on Broadway.\n- One of the actors from Hamilton won the best actor award.\n- The actor playing Thomas Jefferson won the best actor award.\n- Daveed Diggs played Thomas Jefferson.\n- Musicals on Broadway are not films.\n\nThe conclusion is:\n- Daveed Diggs won the best actor award.\n\nFrom the first and third premises, we can conclude that Daveed Diggs won the best actor award since he played Thomas Jefferson, who won the award.\n\nANSWER: True\n\n9.\n\nThe premises are:\n- Ambiortus is a prehistoric mammal genus.\n- Ambiortus Dementjevi is the only known species of Ambiortus.\n- Mars was where Ambiortus Dementjevi lived.\n- Adele was the discoverer of Ambiortus.\n\nThe conclusion is:\n- Adele discovered a new mammal genus.\n\nSince Ambiortus Dementjevi is the only known species of Ambiortus, and Adele discovered Ambiortus, we can conclude that

Since all paper is biodegradable, it can be concluded that a worksheet is either biodegradable or environment-friendly. However, nothing can be both biodegradable and environment-friendly at the same time, so we cannot conclude that a worksheet is biodegradable or environment-friendly. Therefore, the conclusion that \"A worksheet is not biodegradable\" is uncertain.\n\nANSWER: Uncertain\n\n2. \n\nThe premises are given as follows:\n\n- A La Liga soccer team ranks higher than another La Liga soccer team if it receives more points.\n- If there are two La Liga soccer teams and neither has more points than the other, then the team which receives more points from the games between the two teams ranks higher.\n- Real Madrid and Barcelona are both La Liga soccer teams.\n- Real Madrid received more points than Barcelona.\n- Neither Real Madrid nor Barcelona received more points from the games between them.\n\nFrom the premises, we can conclude that Real Madrid ranks higher than Barcelona because it received more points than Barcelona.\n\nANSWER: True\n\n3. \n\nThe premises are given as follows:\n\n- All professional athletes spend most of their time on sports.\n- All Olympic gold medal winners are professional athletes.\n- No full-time scientists spend the majority of their time on sports.\n- All Nobel physics laureates are full-time scientists.\n- Amy spends the most time on sports, or Amy is an Olympic gold medal winner.\n- If Amy is not a Nobel physics laureate, then Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner.\n\nFrom the premises, we can conclude that if Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner, then Amy must be a Nobel physics laureate because there are no other options left for her. This is because if Amy is not an Olympic gold medal winner, then she must be a professional athlete, but this is impossible because all professional athletes spend most of their time on sports, and if Amy spends the most time on sports, then she is an Olympic gold medal winner.\n\nANSWER: False\n\n4. \n\nThe premises are given as follows:\n\n- If a person pays their taxes, then they contribute to the country.\n- Everyone who works for a government department pays a tax on their salary.\n- Everyone in the army is an employee of a government department.\n- Everyone convicted of murder goes to prison.\n- Everyone who has been to prison has a criminal record.\n- James was either once convicted of murder, or spent time in prison.\n- James either has a criminal record, or pays his taxes.\n\nFrom the premises, we cannot conclude that James does not contribute to the country. There are two possible scenarios: James has a criminal record or James pays his taxes. If James has a criminal record, then we cannot conclude anything about his contribution to the country. If James pays his taxes, then we can conclude that he contributes to the country.\n\nANSWER: Uncertain\n\n5. \n\nThe premises are given as follows:\n\n- No songs are visuals.\n- All folk songs are songs.\n- All videos are visuals.\n- All movies are videos.\n- All sci-fi movies are movies.\n- Inception is a sci-fi movie.\n- Mac is neither a folk song nor a sci-fi movie.\n\nFrom the premises, we can conclude that Inception is a movie.

Since all Nobel physics laureates are full-time scientists, it implies that Amy is not a Nobel physics laureate. Therefore, ANSWER: True.\n\n4. \nIf a person pays their taxes, then they contribute to the country.\nEveryone who works for a government department pays a tax on their salary.\nEveryone in the army is an employee of a government department.\nEveryone convicted of murder goes to prison.\nEveryone who has been to prison has a criminal record.\nJames was either once convicted of murder, or spent time in prison.\nJames either has a criminal record, or pays his taxes.\n<CONCLUSION>\nJames does not contribute to the country.\n</CONCLUSION>\n<EVALUATE>\nGiven the premises, we cannot determine whether James pays his taxes or not, and therefore whether he contributes to the country or not. If James has a criminal record, then he must have been convicted of murder or spent time in prison, but it does not imply that he pays his taxes. Therefore, ANSWER: Uncertain.\n\n5. \nNo songs are visuals.\nAll folk songs are songs.\nAll videos are visuals.\nAll movies are videos.\nAll sci-fi movies are movies.\nInception is a sci-fi movie.\nMac is neither a folk song nor a sci-fi movie.\n<CONCLUSION>\nInception is a folk song.\n</CONCLUSION>\n<EVALUATE>\nGiven the premises, Inception is a sci-fi movie, and all sci-fi movies are movies. All movies are videos, and all videos are visuals. Since no songs are visuals, Inception cannot be a folk song. Therefore, ANSWER: False.\n\n6. \nEvery chef can cook.\nSome people who aren\u2019t chefs can cook.\nPeople who cook can make scrambled eggs and pasta.\nIf someone can make cookies and muffins, they are a baker.\nBakers who can also make scrambled eggs can make a good breakfast.\nLuke can make cookies, scrambled eggs, and muffins, but not pasta.\n<CONCLUSION>\nLuke is a chef.\n</CONCLUSION>\n<EVALUATE>\nGiven the premises, Luke can make cookies, scrambled eggs, and muffins, but not pasta. Since people who cook can make scrambled eggs and pasta, it implies that Luke is not a person who cooks. Therefore, ANSWER: False.\n\n7. \nETS develops various standardized tests primarily in the United States for K-12 and higher education.\nETS administers international tests, including the TOEFL, TOEIC, GRE, and subject tests.\nMany of the assessments ETS develops are associated with entry to the US tertiary and quaternary education institutions.\nETS also develops K-12 statewide assessments used for accountability testing in many states.\n<CONCLUSION>\nETS doesn't administer tests internationally.\n</CONCLUSION>\n<EVALUATE>\nGiven the premises, ETS administers international tests, including the TOEFL, TOEIC, GRE, and subject tests.

Therefore, a worksheet can't be both biodegradable and not biodegradable, which makes it uncertain whether a worksheet is biodegradable.\n\nHowever, the above analysis is not precise. To be precise, we can analyze the conclusion as follows:\n\n- If a worksheet is paper, then it is biodegradable (premises 3 and 2).\n- If a worksheet is environment-friendly, then it is biodegradable (premise 1).\n- However, premise 5 states that nothing is a good thing and also a bad thing. Therefore, if a worksheet is environment-friendly, then it is good (premise 5), and hence it is not bad.\n- Premise 6 states that a worksheet is either paper or environment-friendly. If it is paper, then it is biodegradable.

But since all professional athletes spend most of their time on sports, and Amy spends the most time on sports, she must be a professional athlete. However, the premises also state that all professional athletes are either Olympic gold medal winners or full-time scientists. Since Amy is neither an Olympic gold medal winner nor a Nobel physics laureate, the conclusion does not follow from the premises.

Therefore, the conclusion is uncertain.\n\nANSWER: Uncertain", "Here are the evaluations of the conclusions for each problem:\n\n1. <PREMISES>\nAll biodegradable things are environment-friendly.\nAll woodware is biodegradable.\nAll paper is woodware.\nNothing is a good thing and also a bad thing.\nAll environment-friendly things are good.\nA worksheet is either paper or environment-friendly.\n</PREMISES>\n<CONCLUSION>\nA worksheet is not biodegradable.\n</CONCLUSION>\n<EVALUATE>\nANSWER: Uncertain", "Here are the solutions to each problem:\n\n1.\n\n<PREMISES>\nAll biodegradable things are environment-friendly.\nAll woodware is biodegradable.\nAll paper is woodware.\nNothing is a good thing and also a bad thing.\nAll environment-friendly things are good.\nA worksheet is either paper or environment-friendly.\n</PREMISES>\n<CONCLUSION>\nA worksheet is not biodegradable.\n</CONCLUSION>\n<EVALUATE>\nTo evaluate this conclusion, we need to determine if it is possible for a worksheet to be biodegradable given the premises. Since all paper is woodware and all woodware is biodegradable, we can conclude that all paper is biodegradable. Additionally, a worksheet is either paper or environment-friendly. Therefore, if a worksheet is paper, then it is biodegradable. However, it does not follow that a worksheet cannot be biodegradable. It is possible that a worksheet is environment-friendly but not paper, in which case it could be biodegradable. Therefore, the conclusion does not follow from the premises.\n\nANSWER: Uncertain", "Here are the evaluations of the conclusions given the premises:\n\n1. \nThe premises are given in the form of a set of first-order logic sentences.\nThe conclusion is given in the form of a single first-order logic sentence.\nPremises:\n- \u2200x (EnvironmentFriendly(x) \u2192 Biodegradable(x))\n- \u2200x (Woodware(x) \u2192 Biodegradable(x))\n- \u2200x (Paper(x) \u2192 Woodware(x))\n- \u2200x \u00ac(Good(x) \u2227 Bad(x))\n- \u2200x (EnvironmentFriendly(x) \u2192 Good(x))\n- \u2200x (Worksheet(x) \u2192 (Paper(x) \u2228 EnvironmentFriendly(x)))\nConclusion:\n- \u00acBiodegradable(Worksheet(x))\nEvaluation:\nThe conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises.

The third premise states that R1 receives more points than R2, and the fourth premise states that R1 does not receive more points from the games between R1 and R2 than R2. Therefore, R1 does not rank higher than R2, and since the ranking is a total order, R2 must rank higher than R1, which is a contradiction.
