From the first premise, we have that 6, 7, and 8 are imaginary numbers.\n2. From the second premise, if an imaginary number equals another imaginary number added by one, the first number is larger. In our case, we have 7 = 6 + 1, so 7 is larger than 6 according to the second premise.\n3. From the third premise, if x is larger than y, then y is not larger than x. In our case, 7 is larger than 6, so 6 is not larger than 7.\n4. From the fourth premise, we have that 8 = 7 + 1, so 8 is larger than 7 according to the second premise.\n5. From the third premise, if x is larger than y, then y is not larger than x. In our case, 8 is larger than 7, so 7 is not larger than 8.\n6. Since 6 and 7 are both imaginary numbers and neither is larger than the other, they are not the numbers we are looking for in the conclusion.\n7. From the sixth premise, we have that 9 = 2 * 6.\n8. From the fifth premise, if x is larger than y, then y is not larger than x. In our case, 9 is larger than 6 according to the equality 9 = 2 * 6.\n9. From the seventh premise, if a number is negative, then the double of it is also negative. In our case, 2 is negative, so 9, being the double of 6, must be negative as well.\n10. From the conclusion, we are looking for a contradiction, i.e., a worksheet being both biodegradable and not biodegradable.
